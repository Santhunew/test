0:0:0.0 --> 0:0:0.150
Klajko, Robert (External)
Hello.
0:0:6.170 --> 0:0:6.390
Mishra, Rutuparnna (External)
OK.
0:0:8.750 --> 0:0:9.310
Klajko, Robert (External)
I Rutuparnna.
0:0:11.930 --> 0:0:15.100
Klajko, Robert (External)
Let's see if so.
0:0:15.110 --> 0:0:19.850
Klajko, Robert (External)
So we need to see FLS team representatives in this in this meeting.
0:0:23.760 --> 0:0:24.990
Klajko, Robert (External)
Uh, who can?
0:0:25.240 --> 0:0:27.660
Klajko, Robert (External)
Who can help us to get hold of them?
0:0:30.160 --> 0:0:30.400
Mishra, Rutuparnna (External)
Both.
0:0:30.480 --> 0:0:31.820
Mishra, Rutuparnna (External)
So can you please suggest?
0:0:32.760 --> 0:0:33.960
Klajko, Robert (External)
I I can't hear you. Sorry.
0:0:35.510 --> 0:0:35.880
Mishra, Rutuparnna (External)
No, no.
0:0:35.890 --> 0:0:38.370
Mishra, Rutuparnna (External)
I'm asking Santhosh too suggest on it.
0:0:39.550 --> 0:0:40.90
Klajko, Robert (External)
Yeah. OK.
0:0:44.550 --> 0:0:45.370
C, Santhosh Kumar (External)
Let me check this.
0:0:46.440 --> 0:0:47.60
Mishra, Rutuparnna (External)
Yeah. OK.
0:1:40.220 --> 0:1:45.480
Rosales, Dianne Gojo
Hello team escalation here, and with Duper who's the recovery manager?
0:1:52.270 --> 0:1:52.980
Rosales, Dianne Gojo
Rutuparnna.
0:1:53.490 --> 0:1:55.290
Rosales, Dianne Gojo
Who's the recovery manager for this?
0:1:56.920 --> 0:1:57.590
Mishra, Rutuparnna (External)
Yes, I'm too.
0:1:56.290 --> 0:1:57.690
N U, Chandu (External)
OK, we have some tool from other two.
0:1:59.410 --> 0:2:0.960
Rosales, Dianne Gojo
Chontosh hi.
0:2:0.970 --> 0:2:1.940
Rosales, Dianne Gojo
Santosh can you?
0:2:4.260 --> 0:2:5.550
Rosales, Dianne Gojo
Can you give us more details?
0:2:5.560 --> 0:2:6.730
Rosales, Dianne Gojo
This is client impacting.
0:2:19.410 --> 0:2:20.550
Klajko, Robert (External)
Hello, Dan, can you hear me?
0:2:21.70 --> 0:2:21.190
Rosales, Dianne Gojo
Yes.
0:2:22.310 --> 0:2:22.720
Klajko, Robert (External)
Yeah.
0:2:22.730 --> 0:2:24.960
Klajko, Robert (External)
So let me give you just a very brief update.
0:2:24.970 --> 0:2:36.870
Klajko, Robert (External)
So it is not impacting the client right now, but there is a high risk that it will impact them on next Monday or Tuesday.
0:2:39.50 --> 0:2:39.310
Rosales, Dianne Gojo
OK.
0:2:37.160 --> 0:2:40.470
Klajko, Robert (External)
Maybe we don't know, but the what?
0:2:40.480 --> 0:2:48.800
Klajko, Robert (External)
We experienced that the RFR application and it's getting slow by every day.
0:2:48.810 --> 0:3:10.690
Klajko, Robert (External)
Basically the calculation or the processing time getting getting larger every day and now as we see the situation, it is very high risk that it will exceed the the configured and available time window for the calculation.
0:3:10.700 --> 0:3:12.560
Klajko, Robert (External)
So the publication will be delayed.
0:3:14.550 --> 0:3:15.250
Klajko, Robert (External)
And we would like.
0:3:14.530 --> 0:3:19.90
Rosales, Dianne Gojo
Do we know which impact this is is for which product?
0:3:20.100 --> 0:3:21.260
Klajko, Robert (External)
Yes, of course.
0:3:21.490 --> 0:3:28.400
Klajko, Robert (External)
The term Sonia Tourmaster and Tokyo ShopRite AM and PM.
0:3:28.650 --> 0:3:32.150
Klajko, Robert (External)
These are the four benchmark rates.
0:3:31.680 --> 0:3:33.470
Rosales, Dianne Gojo
But but what?
0:3:33.480 --> 0:3:35.270
Rosales, Dianne Gojo
What products is gonna be impacted?
0:3:35.280 --> 0:3:36.380
Rosales, Dianne Gojo
Is it icon or?
0:3:37.620 --> 0:3:37.960
Rosales, Dianne Gojo
There's.
0:3:37.550 --> 0:3:38.220
Klajko, Robert (External)
Or Fr.
0:3:42.520 --> 0:3:43.280
Klajko, Robert (External)
Oh yeah. OK.
0:3:42.210 --> 0:3:43.540
Rosales, Dianne Gojo
OK, all the applications.
0:3:38.70 --> 0:3:43.730
Flagg, Todd
So all of these applications fall feed into icon through TRC E.
0:3:46.110 --> 0:3:54.10
Flagg, Todd
So basically the the rates themselves are part of an umbrella apply application called risk free rates.
0:3:54.450 --> 0:3:56.220
Flagg, Todd
As part of that, we have individual rates.
0:3:56.230 --> 0:3:57.260
Flagg, Todd
They're getting published.
0:3:57.270 --> 0:3:59.20
Flagg, Todd
These are all regulated benchmarks.
0:3:59.100 --> 0:4:3.230
Flagg, Todd
For the most part, uh and IBS critical services.
0:4:4.480 --> 0:4:7.660
Flagg, Todd
So, uh, hence the TRT.
0:4:9.0 --> 0:4:9.910
Rosales, Dianne Gojo
Understood.
0:4:10.250 --> 0:4:10.430
Flagg, Todd
Hmm.
0:4:10.40 --> 0:4:13.360
Rosales, Dianne Gojo
Any, uh hot topic that we have in place for active link?
0:4:14.660 --> 0:4:20.150
Flagg, Todd
No, this was just kind of initially uncovered kind of yesterday and then it has continued into today.
0:4:20.160 --> 0:4:28.30
Flagg, Todd
So that's why we raising a TRT to get all the necessary parties together to try to make sure we reduce this impact.
0:4:29.780 --> 0:4:30.300
Rosales, Dianne Gojo
Understood.
0:4:30.310 --> 0:4:32.700
Rosales, Dianne Gojo
So for now, there's no client impact it yet.
0:4:35.270 --> 0:4:37.990
Flagg, Todd
Actually, I think the only problem is I think we published late yesterday.
0:4:39.250 --> 0:4:43.30
Flagg, Todd
So usually like basically what has to happen is these rates have to publish by specific time.
0:4:47.40 --> 0:4:47.930
Klajko, Robert (External)
And don't don't.
0:4:44.370 --> 0:4:48.980
Flagg, Todd
Umm, sorry from misremembering this, but it I believe the rates published like 2 minutes late yesterday.
0:4:47.940 --> 0:4:50.90
Klajko, Robert (External)
I'm not aware of any so sorry.
0:4:50.100 --> 0:4:52.550
Klajko, Robert (External)
Sorry, I'm not aware of any late publishing yesterday.
0:4:52.960 --> 0:4:55.0
Klajko, Robert (External)
What which?
0:4:53.110 --> 0:4:56.150
Flagg, Todd
OK, it was just close, is that right?
0:4:58.270 --> 0:4:59.760
Klajko, Robert (External)
It it wasn't close.
0:5:0.680 --> 0:5:2.460
Klajko, Robert (External)
Which rate are you talking about? Sorry.
0:5:3.560 --> 0:5:9.90
Flagg, Todd
Well, I mean ultimately this got raised as part of term Sonia publication yesterday this morning.
0:5:9.360 --> 0:5:9.640
Klajko, Robert (External)
Yeah.
0:5:9.100 --> 0:5:15.800
Flagg, Todd
I believe that Tokyo swap Perry was taking a an extended amount of time and then it was close to.
0:5:17.640 --> 0:5:20.650
Flagg, Todd
A critical deadline for it to be published.
0:5:22.940 --> 0:5:23.160
Klajko, Robert (External)
Is it?
0:5:22.240 --> 0:5:27.570
Flagg, Todd
In actuality, the entire process should take less than 10 minutes, and it's taking like over 20 or something, right?
0:5:28.50 --> 0:5:29.180
Klajko, Robert (External)
Yeah, that that was.
0:5:29.250 --> 0:5:30.960
Klajko, Robert (External)
Yeah, that is true for term, Sonia.
0:5:31.10 --> 0:5:31.340
Klajko, Robert (External)
Yes.
0:5:31.350 --> 0:5:38.180
Klajko, Robert (External)
And also the the users observed the longer processing time for Tokyo swap rate.
0:5:38.190 --> 0:5:42.420
Klajko, Robert (External)
However, the exact time, I mean minutes are different.
0:5:46.300 --> 0:5:46.540
Flagg, Todd
Yeah.
0:5:42.430 --> 0:5:49.480
Klajko, Robert (External)
But yeah, the ratio is similar, so we are getting close to the end of the available time frame.
0:5:50.990 --> 0:5:55.230
Klajko, Robert (External)
That's true, but we didn't have laid publication yesterday needed today.
0:5:54.450 --> 0:6:0.160
Flagg, Todd
OK, well, let's get this fixed before we start having laid publications, right.
0:5:59.750 --> 0:6:0.660
Klajko, Robert (External)
Yes, indeed.
0:6:1.110 --> 0:6:1.610
Rosales, Dianne Gojo
Exactly.
0:6:0.670 --> 0:6:2.160
Klajko, Robert (External)
Indeed, that's that's the purpose.
0:6:2.250 --> 0:6:2.690
Klajko, Robert (External)
Yeah, yeah.
0:6:7.240 --> 0:6:11.940
Rosales, Dianne Gojo
The Zhang, Josh considering the impact on this uh, since this is gonna be ideal.
0:6:11.950 --> 0:6:14.340
Rosales, Dianne Gojo
Service did did we propose this is major?
0:6:17.520 --> 0:6:20.430
Flagg, Todd
Yes, I think at the short in the short term, we can always change them.
0:6:34.390 --> 0:6:35.460
Flagg, Todd
In Diane, I apologize.
0:6:35.470 --> 0:6:37.20
Flagg, Todd
Are you L1 or L2?
0:6:47.870 --> 0:6:48.30
Flagg, Todd
OK.
0:6:38.30 --> 0:6:49.220
Rosales, Dianne Gojo
I'm with escalation, so I'm checking to see if, uh, we have client impact for this so that we could send in or internal stakeholders some some emails on it.
0:6:49.430 --> 0:6:58.820
Rosales, Dianne Gojo
But the I think if this requires any alert or hot top or hot topic, I think we need to inform relevant teams about it.
0:6:59.70 --> 0:7:4.980
Rosales, Dianne Gojo
So as you T, can create it through actively so that if in case we get queries, at least we're prepared.
0:7:6.850 --> 0:7:10.120
Flagg, Todd
Yeah, I don't think there's any client impact at this time is Robert was mentioning.
0:7:10.190 --> 0:7:15.940
Flagg, Todd
But we do have, it's obviously a concern at the service continues to degradate.
0:7:20.100 --> 0:7:20.920
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
I'm I'm.
0:7:22.750 --> 0:7:25.970
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
Hi I'm from Telugu CFS that level support.
0:7:31.520 --> 0:7:32.150
Klajko, Robert (External)
Yeah.
0:7:32.160 --> 0:7:32.430
Klajko, Robert (External)
Hi.
0:7:32.580 --> 0:7:33.400
Klajko, Robert (External)
Hi akechi.
0:7:33.480 --> 0:7:34.200
Klajko, Robert (External)
Thanks for joining.
0:7:34.110 --> 0:7:35.70
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
Yeah, yeah.
0:7:35.100 --> 0:7:39.280
Klajko, Robert (External)
Umm, we will need your help for sure.
0:7:40.200 --> 0:7:43.100
Klajko, Robert (External)
Umm, can we go into the details now?
0:7:44.800 --> 0:7:49.570
Flagg, Todd
I think the only problem I have is that do we need to get like a quick do we have the right?
0:7:49.620 --> 0:7:54.60
Flagg, Todd
Like I see Matt matched you'll everything the.
0:7:57.40 --> 0:7:57.670
Flagg, Todd
Yeah.
0:7:57.900 --> 0:8:2.130
Flagg, Todd
I mean, I think we need to get like a summary of the kind of situation that we're looking at at the moment.
0:8:4.40 --> 0:8:6.330
Flagg, Todd
Umm do we have someone who's like from L2?
0:8:6.340 --> 0:8:8.180
Flagg, Todd
Who's actually like driving the recovery, though?
0:8:8.880 --> 0:8:10.300
Flagg, Todd
That's the only my main concern.
0:8:17.940 --> 0:8:19.120
Klajko, Robert (External)
What recovery I'm.
0:8:28.430 --> 0:8:28.700
Klajko, Robert (External)
Hmm.
0:8:19.800 --> 0:8:33.410
Flagg, Todd
So it's a TRT call, so I need someone here who's at least acknowledging that we have the right people in place who can make a call out if necessary or push L1 to make an call out if necessary, and most importantly, take notes.
0:8:35.850 --> 0:8:37.80
Flagg, Todd
Of the actual recovery call.
0:8:41.390 --> 0:8:42.150
Flagg, Todd
So apologize.
0:8:42.160 --> 0:8:43.130
Flagg, Todd
Who's from El 2?
0:8:45.980 --> 0:8:46.590
C, Santhosh Kumar (External)
Yeah, I'm here.
0:8:47.610 --> 0:8:47.900
Flagg, Todd
OK.
0:8:47.910 --> 0:8:48.650
Flagg, Todd
So it's santosh.
0:8:48.660 --> 0:8:49.20
Flagg, Todd
OK.
0:8:49.70 --> 0:8:49.390
Flagg, Todd
Thank you.
0:8:50.180 --> 0:8:50.880
Flagg, Todd
OK, so.
0:8:53.300 --> 0:9:0.830
Flagg, Todd
Primarily, I think we just have an issue like Edward, I think you give a very good explanation earlier and you image it here.
0:9:1.600 --> 0:9:11.470
Flagg, Todd
UM, uh and L3 from CFS as well, so I think either yourself or Sergei can give a very quick summary.
0:9:11.580 --> 0:9:21.810
Flagg, Todd
It seems like it's basically there's a there's an issue with the search functionality between, uh, RFR and TFs when trying to do.
0:9:21.850 --> 0:9:27.20
Flagg, Todd
When trying to publish back to CFS of is my the high level topic?
0:9:27.80 --> 0:9:27.490
Flagg, Todd
Is that right?
0:9:28.950 --> 0:9:34.0
Korenschi, Eduard
OK, so if I make make a very short summary, the idea is the following.
0:9:34.250 --> 0:9:52.940
Korenschi, Eduard
The purpose of the application is to compute this benchmark and then to publish certain results once over electron which is not in this discussion and the secondly some artifacts are published through CFS, they are stored in a self persistent storage and published through CFS.
0:9:53.980 --> 0:9:58.30
Korenschi, Eduard
Now, this CFS exposes a hierarchical structures where you have.
0:9:59.180 --> 0:10:3.690
Korenschi, Eduard
What's the good you have buckets and then files are grouped in file set.
0:10:3.700 --> 0:10:3.870
Korenschi, Eduard
Yeah.
0:10:3.880 --> 0:10:27.180
Korenschi, Eduard
So you have buckets, file sets, files when you want to publish something, you get your files and you put them in a file set though, especially when you it happens that your application runs multiple times a day and you don't want to create the same files that multiple times because it will fail the first call before publishing something is to retrieve your file set which we know the name.
0:10:28.130 --> 0:10:35.800
Korenschi, Eduard
Now CFS allows this filtering to be done by bucket and by file set name.
0:10:36.90 --> 0:10:48.20
Korenschi, Eduard
And I tested this and it it turns to me in some 100 milliseconds dance to postman from my laptop when we are trying to use the API that self exposes.
0:10:48.30 --> 0:10:52.530
Korenschi, Eduard
Which kind of for this call doesn't allow us to specify a particular bucket.
0:10:53.490 --> 0:10:55.150
Korenschi, Eduard
The same call takes minutes.
0:10:56.760 --> 0:10:57.670
Korenschi, Eduard
It works.
0:10:57.720 --> 0:11:2.190
Korenschi, Eduard
It gives the proper result, but it takes minutes and this has you know.
0:11:4.210 --> 0:11:6.160
Korenschi, Eduard
Continuous degradation in the past time.
0:11:6.170 --> 0:11:15.750
Korenschi, Eduard
So my initial understanding is that we should somehow revisit how this, uh, cold works and how this translates into a CFS call or not.
0:11:16.10 --> 0:11:17.720
Korenschi, Eduard
At what point in which way?
0:11:18.70 --> 0:11:26.180
Korenschi, Eduard
Because again, I've done this calls directed to CFS and they are in the range of 10s or hundreds of milliseconds, but not minutes.
0:11:29.110 --> 0:11:41.360
Korenschi, Eduard
So that's the issue, yeah, when trying to publishing to publish something, we have to retrieve one of the hierarchical structures and trying to retrieve that structure takes an unexpected amount of time.
0:11:41.490 --> 0:11:50.810
Korenschi, Eduard
And this delays everything that we have to do otherwise and this pushes us close to the publication window and it starts becoming critical.
0:11:50.820 --> 0:11:52.210
Korenschi, Eduard
We haven't been gone.
0:11:52.220 --> 0:11:56.630
Korenschi, Eduard
Be beyond that, but it's getting critical and people are getting a little bit nervous.
0:12:1.510 --> 0:12:3.380
Korenschi, Eduard
That's all on my side if any questions.
0:12:9.510 --> 0:12:10.740
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah, I think there are questions.
0:12:10.750 --> 0:12:25.480
Outenah, Madjid
As I said self, when you do when you do query set check for files that there is there is it's all it's always under the bucket that is reset for you and the and the bucket that is set we set is is used underneath so I don't.
0:12:25.550 --> 0:12:39.350
Outenah, Madjid
I don't see why we have such a difference as the the query you are making is just normally just trying to retrieve a file set by name or or per ID and the call should be straightforward.
0:12:39.360 --> 0:12:44.800
Outenah, Madjid
So I don't really understand why you you had you had a difference when when you tested?
0:12:46.580 --> 0:12:55.440
Outenah, Madjid
So I think the this test method may need to be revisited and when with a with a with our.
0:13:1.960 --> 0:13:2.860
Korenschi, Eduard
They are totally agree.
0:12:55.510 --> 0:13:3.660
Outenah, Madjid
With my developed with my development, because to me it's so it should not make a difference unless there were some cap.
0:13:3.880 --> 0:13:5.540
Outenah, Madjid
Unless there is, I don't know.
0:13:5.550 --> 0:13:12.330
Outenah, Madjid
The CFS guys make may come out whether they have seen any, any any load or capacity.
0:13:12.340 --> 0:13:16.430
Outenah, Madjid
You should also last days, but it it should not.
0:13:16.520 --> 0:13:19.510
Outenah, Madjid
It should not make a difference because you just do a get.
0:13:19.560 --> 0:13:37.80
Outenah, Madjid
I guess you are using a file set name just to see whether you the files that exist or not and get the ID to publish but it should not make a difference because underneath we are just retrieving the file set which is set in the config.
0:13:37.290 --> 0:13:44.500
Outenah, Madjid
The the the bucket and then and then call do this this the similar code so.
0:13:46.670 --> 0:13:52.340
Outenah, Madjid
I can't say more than that at this stage based on the information you are providing.
0:13:57.970 --> 0:14:14.270
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
Do you have a the CFSD quest and the time or UD that you got the request that you mentioned that it's really slow, so I can, you know, go back to CFS side to check O, Barbie.
0:14:14.340 --> 0:14:14.610
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
I'm.
0:14:14.620 --> 0:14:16.50
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
I'm not sure what, why?
0:14:16.120 --> 0:14:19.670
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
Why it's so slow, but let me take a look into the log first.
0:14:20.420 --> 0:14:27.480
Korenschi, Eduard
It it doesn't look to be like one specific time, so that I we need you to to check for some very specific requests we have.
0:14:27.760 --> 0:14:37.150
Korenschi, Eduard
Even written this morning, additional code that just does that tries to retrieve a file set and it it behaves the same.
0:14:37.160 --> 0:14:42.570
Korenschi, Eduard
So it takes minutes to do that, and by direct call to CFS it takes milliseconds so.
0:14:44.700 --> 0:14:46.530
Korenschi, Eduard
And and it's been like this behavior.
0:14:46.540 --> 0:14:58.260
Korenschi, Eduard
It's been degradating over the past couple of months continuously, so definitely somehow related to the amount of things that is published there, but I I don't see what you could.
0:14:58.340 --> 0:15:2.500
Korenschi, Eduard
I mean, I couldn't give you one particular request because all of them behave same.
0:15:1.350 --> 0:15:10.170
Outenah, Madjid
So OK, so it what did you use the same which bucket name you used to when you when you tried when you tried directly?
0:15:15.130 --> 0:15:23.890
Korenschi, Eduard
So when we when we are publishing, we are publishing to RFR TSR output and when we are looking for the file set, we cannot specify the bucket.
0:15:26.420 --> 0:15:30.480
Outenah, Madjid
Yes, but when you said you, you tried to retrieve by specifying the bucket.
0:15:32.470 --> 0:15:32.710
Korenschi, Eduard
Yes.
0:15:32.380 --> 0:15:33.560
Outenah, Madjid
You, you. You.
0:15:40.180 --> 0:15:40.410
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah.
0:15:32.720 --> 0:15:44.90
Korenschi, Eduard
And if I specify the if if yeah, if I actually the CFS API makes this bucket name mandatory, so the bucket that I specify is argue for TSR output.
0:15:45.460 --> 0:15:46.600
Outenah, Madjid
OK, so that's it.
0:15:46.610 --> 0:15:48.280
Outenah, Madjid
Should be the syndicate we are.
0:15:48.750 --> 0:15:49.180
Outenah, Madjid
We are.
0:15:49.350 --> 0:15:50.730
Outenah, Madjid
We are requesting as well.
0:15:53.230 --> 0:15:58.380
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
Umm do you have like you do a D that you normally request a data?
0:15:58.570 --> 0:16:0.130
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
Can you provide me the UHD?
0:16:4.50 --> 0:16:5.790
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah, just provide the machine ID.
0:16:6.280 --> 0:16:7.670
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
Yeah, machine.
0:16:5.800 --> 0:16:8.670
Outenah, Madjid
You in used to do the request, yeah.
0:16:10.970 --> 0:16:14.350
Outenah, Madjid
So can you can you give the machine ID as you are using for that?
0:16:16.120 --> 0:16:17.70
Korenschi, Eduard
I'm trying to get it.
0:16:18.530 --> 0:16:20.140
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
OK, I get that I can take a look.
0:17:15.280 --> 0:17:15.630
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Yeah.
0:17:15.640 --> 0:17:16.110
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
How much?
0:17:16.120 --> 0:17:18.270
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
90 but I don't know how to push it.
0:17:18.280 --> 0:17:20.790
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
I don't have a chat of this call.
0:17:21.220 --> 0:17:24.530
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
I can only share my skin and they show because.
0:17:45.870 --> 0:17:48.290
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
So this is our GP account that we are using.
0:17:54.310 --> 0:17:54.610
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
Yeah.
0:17:55.670 --> 0:17:58.200
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
14063.
0:17:55.920 --> 0:17:59.130
Flagg, Todd
1460 what is that 14063?
0:18:0.620 --> 0:18:1.130
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
Umm.
0:18:7.470 --> 0:18:9.520
Flagg, Todd
In which for which which rate is that for?
0:18:9.570 --> 0:18:11.380
Flagg, Todd
So I'm struggling this morning with my eyes.
0:18:12.670 --> 0:18:12.800
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
And.
0:18:12.920 --> 0:18:15.10
Flagg, Todd
This is just the CFS Connect connection.
0:18:15.20 --> 0:18:15.970
Flagg, Todd
Or is this for all of them?
0:18:14.860 --> 0:18:21.770
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
So doesn't matter what the rate just trying to connect to the bucket and try to get.
0:18:25.200 --> 0:18:25.950
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
I've set name.
0:18:23.550 --> 0:18:27.100
Flagg, Todd
Nor starting this is the exact same one we're using to do.
0:18:26.850 --> 0:18:28.450
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
It's for Sonia.
0:18:28.510 --> 0:18:29.160
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
It's for Sonia.
0:18:29.170 --> 0:18:30.190
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Example user Sonia.
0:18:30.710 --> 0:18:30.930
Flagg, Todd
OK.
0:18:56.770 --> 0:18:58.500
Flagg, Todd
Just going to copy and paste it and paste.
0:18:58.510 --> 0:18:59.400
Flagg, Todd
Anyone needs it in the?
0:19:1.590 --> 0:19:1.870
Flagg, Todd
Uh.
0:19:6.320 --> 0:19:11.180
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
And I created this sample that we can use it for demo if needed.
0:20:10.970 --> 0:20:11.690
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
Give me a second.
0:20:14.450 --> 0:20:14.730
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Sure.
0:21:15.950 --> 0:21:16.380
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
Umm.
0:21:20.910 --> 0:21:21.180
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
OK.
0:21:21.190 --> 0:21:22.270
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
Can I share my screen here?
0:21:29.570 --> 0:21:30.370
Flagg, Todd
You're more than welcome to.
0:21:29.660 --> 0:21:44.170
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
Umm yeah, how quickly the data from RDP Gateway log with this UA D right that request the all the API that files law.
0:21:44.760 --> 0:21:48.490
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
But if you can see the M2 here.
0:21:48.660 --> 0:21:51.120
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
Yeah, the M2 is represent the time.
0:21:51.160 --> 0:21:51.910
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
Let's burn.
0:21:52.360 --> 0:21:59.890
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
This is like a Melissa can, so I'm not sure that when you say that the slow is like a.
0:22:1.870 --> 0:22:2.500
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
Uh.
0:22:2.510 --> 0:22:4.200
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
More than a minute or or what?
0:22:4.250 --> 0:22:7.940
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
When you say slow respond, he said. You.
0:22:7.530 --> 0:22:14.660
Korenschi, Eduard
If I make if I make comment on this one, I see there are all these calls and they are very close in event time stamp.
0:22:15.10 --> 0:22:28.860
Korenschi, Eduard
So if I may assume here that what happens is that somebody's trying to pull the whole content of the bucket by following the links, then the file settings do some things.
0:22:32.810 --> 0:22:37.240
Korenschi, Eduard
OK, so if you see, yeah, the the time stamps, they are likely just one second apart.
0:22:37.250 --> 0:22:51.220
Korenschi, Eduard
And sometimes in the same second, which means that somebody is doing all these calls almost immediately and the which to me it looks like somebody's downloading the whole content of the bucket in, at least in the file.
0:22:51.600 --> 0:22:51.820
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
You know.
0:22:51.230 --> 0:22:52.150
Korenschi, Eduard
So listing the file sets.
0:22:50.440 --> 0:22:52.670
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
It's look like iteration.
0:22:52.780 --> 0:22:56.880
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
It's like we're trying to read everything and check if this name exist or not.
0:22:58.900 --> 0:23:12.920
Korenschi, Eduard
So what this might mean is that the the filtering the the file set by name is done well, but possibly on the sell side by downloading initially the whole file content of the bucket and.
0:23:14.550 --> 0:23:16.170
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
But when you say downloading.
0:23:15.930 --> 0:23:22.510
Outenah, Madjid
Because you you you are doing query you are you are trying to find the file set by name.
0:23:24.550 --> 0:23:24.960
Korenschi, Eduard
Yes.
0:23:24.970 --> 0:23:25.970
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Yes, yes, my name.
0:23:24.970 --> 0:23:29.80
Korenschi, Eduard
And I look like you did this queries are looking are only filtering by bucket.
0:23:30.570 --> 0:23:30.760
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah.
0:23:32.960 --> 0:23:33.130
Outenah, Madjid
No.
0:23:29.880 --> 0:23:35.70
Korenschi, Eduard
There are not filtering by name, so it means that the filtering is done kind of client side.
0:23:36.760 --> 0:23:37.990
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah, it's it's the same.
0:23:38.0 --> 0:23:41.370
Outenah, Madjid
It's always the same bucket, so could.
0:23:42.280 --> 0:23:43.390
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah. OK.
0:23:43.980 --> 0:23:57.200
Outenah, Madjid
I will let me need to to check the code on our side, so maybe we maybe iterating to file the correct file set to to correct, to correct, to find the correct file set ID by name as the bucket is becoming big.
0:24:5.600 --> 0:24:5.950
Outenah, Madjid
Look.
0:24:6.110 --> 0:24:8.430
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah, it's maybe self.
0:24:8.440 --> 0:24:8.660
Outenah, Madjid
Who?
0:24:8.670 --> 0:24:9.790
Outenah, Madjid
Who is iterating there?
0:24:20.640 --> 0:24:21.250
Outenah, Madjid
So what?
0:24:21.260 --> 0:24:22.330
Outenah, Madjid
What color are you doing?
0:24:22.340 --> 0:24:23.960
Outenah, Madjid
You are providing the file set name.
0:24:24.990 --> 0:24:28.200
Korenschi, Eduard
But only if you eat only the file set name is allowed to be.
0:24:32.380 --> 0:24:32.750
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah.
0:24:32.760 --> 0:24:33.580
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah, but no.
0:24:28.650 --> 0:24:35.340
Korenschi, Eduard
If we try to also pass the bucket, so kind of like to create the call with the bucket and file set.
0:24:35.410 --> 0:24:37.570
Korenschi, Eduard
Yeah, we are providing the file set name.
0:24:36.370 --> 0:24:38.580
Outenah, Madjid
Not that, but a. Yeah.
0:24:38.590 --> 0:24:40.490
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah, but that that's fine.
0:24:40.500 --> 0:24:47.780
Outenah, Madjid
But I guess those those CFS allows you to retrieve a file set directly by specifying just the name.
0:24:49.280 --> 0:24:50.430
Korenschi, Eduard
No it doesn't.
0:24:50.480 --> 0:24:52.410
Korenschi, Eduard
It requires the bucket and the files that name.
0:24:52.600 --> 0:24:53.890
Outenah, Madjid
It yeah.
0:24:53.900 --> 0:24:56.420
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah, but the OK the the bucket is fine.
0:24:56.430 --> 0:25:5.120
Outenah, Madjid
So the you can see the bucket is is, is so you are you are you have a query which allows CFS to retrieve the file set. Umm.
0:25:5.790 --> 0:25:9.780
Korenschi, Eduard
One of the reasons maybe I'm just again with the maybes here.
0:25:14.510 --> 0:25:14.730
Outenah, Madjid
Try.
0:25:9.890 --> 0:25:21.740
Korenschi, Eduard
Why this was implemented this way is that side file, a CFS doesn't allow looking for file set name like so it only supports exact file set matching.
0:25:21.750 --> 0:25:24.610
Korenschi, Eduard
So maybe you want to make.
0:25:23.750 --> 0:25:40.530
Outenah, Madjid
Yes, I no and the name can be I I believe the the idea the really the idea is the you can have multiple facet with the same name but the idea makes the difference and and that's why why you do query.
0:25:42.440 --> 0:25:58.530
Outenah, Madjid
I don't think the name is a key within CFS and make sure the people from CFS may correct me if I'm wrong and when we we when you do a query by by name we we have to look for for all the for all the name unless the API has changed.
0:26:0.510 --> 0:26:0.870
Outenah, Madjid
So.
0:25:59.820 --> 0:26:3.380
Korenschi, Eduard
But API the CFS API allows for looking for name by name.
0:26:6.260 --> 0:26:7.250
Korenschi, Eduard
By bucket and name.
0:26:4.940 --> 0:26:9.70
Outenah, Madjid
Uh, OK, so that's not the that's not OK.
0:26:9.80 --> 0:26:10.350
Outenah, Madjid
I think that's not the way. It's.
0:26:10.440 --> 0:26:18.480
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah, yeah, the but the again, the bouquet you, we don't you don't specify the bucket because the bucket is is is coming from this from.
0:26:19.910 --> 0:26:25.680
Outenah, Madjid
From the settings where you are allowed as a publisher, so you don't need to pass it, it's always a.
0:26:25.690 --> 0:26:37.760
Outenah, Madjid
Refer to as a TSV output when you do query within self with the API, it always inject by default the bucket that is that that is defined in the setting.
0:26:39.20 --> 0:26:50.290
Outenah, Madjid
Uh, for you as a as a publisher, then what it does when it looks for file name, it looks to to to all the to all the.
0:26:52.590 --> 0:26:58.720
Outenah, Madjid
I think it looks too too older to the entire bucket to find the the the file set with that file name.
0:27:0.410 --> 0:27:2.940
Korenschi, Eduard
But it's not by file name, it's by file set name.
0:27:4.150 --> 0:27:5.630
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah, but if I said name yes.
0:27:6.340 --> 0:27:6.750
Korenschi, Eduard
Yeah.
0:27:5.640 --> 0:27:8.260
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah, obviously it's a file set name, yeah.
0:27:6.760 --> 0:27:14.130
Korenschi, Eduard
And again I what I was saying is that there is the CFX CFS exposes the query by bucket plus file set name.
0:27:14.560 --> 0:27:19.330
Korenschi, Eduard
So this could be translated directly into one single call, and that one is quite fast.
0:27:20.310 --> 0:27:21.330
Outenah, Madjid
Said to quit.
0:27:19.340 --> 0:27:24.180
Korenschi, Eduard
So yeah, just the tech team should look into it and see what the implementation but.
0:27:26.650 --> 0:27:29.380
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah, I'm looking to the Kurds.
0:27:30.590 --> 0:27:31.410
Outenah, Madjid
I think we are.
0:27:31.470 --> 0:27:31.820
Outenah, Madjid
We are.
0:27:31.830 --> 0:27:32.730
Outenah, Madjid
We are iterating.
0:27:34.580 --> 0:27:38.650
Outenah, Madjid
We provide the files that could be a bucket name and.
0:27:40.970 --> 0:27:42.900
Outenah, Madjid
And that's the way it is retrieved for now.
0:27:44.540 --> 0:27:44.670
Outenah, Madjid
That.
0:27:48.110 --> 0:27:49.870
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
That is a bottleneck, I believe.
0:27:50.930 --> 0:27:52.210
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah, yeah.
0:27:54.120 --> 0:27:55.370
Outenah, Madjid
I see you may.
0:27:55.380 --> 0:28:1.30
Outenah, Madjid
Uh, yeah, you are getting all the file sets so you are not deleting them, so you are getting a big number.
0:28:2.270 --> 0:28:13.330
Outenah, Madjid
So I guess as I guess as a workaround, you may directly to the query to check if it if the file set exist outside the outside.
0:28:14.910 --> 0:28:19.610
Outenah, Madjid
Don't use the the self appear I for that to check if the file settings.
0:28:18.260 --> 0:28:20.400
Korenschi, Eduard
But can we access the CFS API directly?
0:28:23.450 --> 0:28:25.250
Outenah, Madjid
Yes, with our DP you can.
0:28:25.310 --> 0:28:27.820
Outenah, Madjid
You could because it's a I.
0:28:27.890 --> 0:28:33.30
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah, I believe it's a part of the browsing, so you should in the same way you do.
0:28:33.230 --> 0:28:35.500
Outenah, Madjid
You do, you do retrieval of files.
0:28:38.190 --> 0:28:38.700
Korenschi, Eduard
Yeah.
0:28:35.510 --> 0:28:42.740
Outenah, Madjid
You may, I think the file set retrieval of file set may be part of the I.
0:28:46.360 --> 0:28:50.80
Outenah, Madjid
Part of the room of the subscriber API or the wires.
0:28:50.90 --> 0:28:51.530
Outenah, Madjid
What will have to do is to.
0:28:52.700 --> 0:28:53.340
Outenah, Madjid
We'll need to.
0:28:55.860 --> 0:29:4.650
Outenah, Madjid
To create A to create a new method if the if the method exists directly to to query the files, the file set by name.
0:29:6.590 --> 0:29:7.470
Outenah, Madjid
There is a fine.
0:29:7.510 --> 0:29:11.170
Outenah, Madjid
OK, there is a fine fight set, I guess, yeah.
0:29:17.950 --> 0:29:18.700
Outenah, Madjid
That's.
0:29:19.210 --> 0:29:24.730
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah, I think, yeah, I think I need to to to give this to the to the development team to analyze further.
0:29:27.160 --> 0:29:38.360
Outenah, Madjid
To to what I can understand that at my level and and if there is a, if there is a if and the cheques from CFS.
0:29:38.570 --> 0:29:46.430
Outenah, Madjid
Can you confirm if the if the file set query it's part of the subscriber API or or publisher API?
0:29:54.100 --> 0:29:57.70
Outenah, Madjid
Make sure there's no third level support who can tell?
0:29:57.540 --> 0:29:57.820
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah.
0:29:57.830 --> 0:30:7.110
Outenah, Madjid
Otherwise, if the if it is part of the of the of the subscriber API, you can in the same way you you call to to to retrieve the file you should.
0:30:7.380 --> 0:30:11.320
Outenah, Madjid
You should maybe able to to be able to go to Rio.
0:30:12.820 --> 0:30:13.130
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
Umm.
0:30:12.810 --> 0:30:15.330
Outenah, Madjid
Uh to get the file set it's you.
0:30:15.340 --> 0:30:19.920
Outenah, Madjid
You may check on the the in the file setup here of the ID if it is available, yeah.
0:30:22.30 --> 0:30:23.670
Outenah, Madjid
Sorry, you want this.
0:30:22.150 --> 0:30:23.850
Klajko, Robert (External)
A Chinese Chinese from.
0:30:23.870 --> 0:30:24.280
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
You're my.
0:30:25.530 --> 0:30:25.730
Klajko, Robert (External)
Yeah.
0:30:25.110 --> 0:30:34.680
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
I don't have a answer now, so not sure that can I go back to check with my dev and you know confirm you again about the question.
0:30:34.580 --> 0:30:36.200
Outenah, Madjid
Yep, OK.
0:30:39.10 --> 0:30:39.500
Outenah, Madjid
Yes.
0:30:39.590 --> 0:30:40.460
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah, that should be.
0:30:55.220 --> 0:31:2.200
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
OK, let let let me ping him whether he he he can try the the the call or not give me give.
0:31:1.630 --> 0:31:2.650
Outenah, Madjid
OK. Yeah.
0:32:14.660 --> 0:32:19.430
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
Uh, give he some few minute and he will join soon, OK?
0:32:20.390 --> 0:32:21.10
Outenah, Madjid
OK. Yeah.
0:32:39.450 --> 0:32:41.630
Flagg, Todd
So for my kind of owned sanity here.
0:32:43.430 --> 0:32:44.120
Flagg, Todd
UM.
0:32:46.120 --> 0:32:52.830
Flagg, Todd
I'm guessing that would not require if we are able to connect to CFS directly through RDP.
0:32:55.690 --> 0:33:7.920
Flagg, Todd
UMI I'm hoping that's not like an architecturally significant kind of change to the system because I thought we had everything going through that self API. Imagine.
0:33:9.350 --> 0:33:14.750
Outenah, Madjid
No, not everything is going through the self Pi when, when, when you retrieve.
0:33:16.320 --> 0:33:19.270
Outenah, Madjid
Fight from CFS that are published by DFD.
0:33:22.430 --> 0:33:22.630
Flagg, Todd
OK.
0:33:19.280 --> 0:33:28.750
Outenah, Madjid
For example, you don't go through the self Pi, you go directly through the RDP or LDPI now uh what?
0:33:28.760 --> 0:33:42.710
Outenah, Madjid
What I am saying is if if we need to do a quick fix, you could potentially replace this the call you are making for checking if the files that exists by an equivalent call without the API if that exist.
0:33:43.990 --> 0:33:44.540
Outenah, Madjid
Umm.
0:33:45.330 --> 0:34:5.800
Outenah, Madjid
And then otherwise, we will have on our side to to create to, to update our method because our method is is iterating to to I and I need to confirm with the dev team because obviously my my my deep knowledge on the implementation is limited.
0:34:6.370 --> 0:34:14.420
Outenah, Madjid
It is really the case if we are iterating that we do, we may need to have to create a new API call that that basically does the.
0:34:16.530 --> 0:34:27.460
Outenah, Madjid
Does the direct request instead of trying to iterate to find the to find the file set by by name, because I believe there are many, there could be many.
0:34:27.540 --> 0:34:32.210
Outenah, Madjid
So initially what we have been noted that the idea is the file set ID not the file segment.
0:34:43.430 --> 0:34:43.750
Outenah, Madjid
So.
0:36:0.370 --> 0:36:12.160
Outenah, Madjid
But anyway, I guess this the this method exist, I'm just if it were, does as a as said he was able to retrieve it directly, so I guess you did you use the R, DPI to do that?
0:36:12.330 --> 0:36:12.830
Outenah, Madjid
It would.
0:36:12.150 --> 0:36:14.690
Korenschi, Eduard
No, no, I I I haven't.
0:36:14.700 --> 0:36:23.370
Korenschi, Eduard
I just looked at the CFS API directly because we were using CFS also on the other front, on the RF UI and it's Java.
0:36:24.860 --> 0:36:25.870
Outenah, Madjid
Uh, Java.
0:36:25.880 --> 0:36:26.470
Outenah, Madjid
It's a Java.
0:36:23.380 --> 0:36:27.730
Korenschi, Eduard
So we had to just use the guest full API and but the audio library.
0:36:32.400 --> 0:36:32.730
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah.
0:36:32.740 --> 0:36:35.590
Outenah, Madjid
Because you, you, you, you are subscribe.
0:36:27.740 --> 0:36:37.640
Korenschi, Eduard
I think it's if it has any kind of CFS, it's all offers also on top of CFS API and yeah it it allows filtering, allows filtering by.
0:36:36.550 --> 0:36:37.940
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah, you are subscriber.
0:36:38.570 --> 0:36:40.20
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah, you are subscriber.
0:36:40.30 --> 0:36:45.80
Outenah, Madjid
So I guess with your application you are subscribers it should be available.
0:36:46.920 --> 0:36:47.140
Korenschi, Eduard
Well.
0:36:49.850 --> 0:36:50.0
Korenschi, Eduard
Yeah.
0:36:51.930 --> 0:36:59.60
Korenschi, Eduard
So filtering by bucket and name it takes like a from my laptop it takes like 100 milliseconds.
0:37:1.60 --> 0:37:1.240
Korenschi, Eduard
And.
0:37:5.360 --> 0:37:5.930
Korenschi, Eduard
Definitely.
0:37:5.940 --> 0:37:7.200
Korenschi, Eduard
It's getting all over.
0:37:7.400 --> 0:37:8.840
Korenschi, Eduard
All those takes a bit longer.
0:37:13.720 --> 0:37:20.900
Korenschi, Eduard
But the selfie API for this part is on top of Rd library or is just a handwritten.
0:37:21.970 --> 0:37:26.20
Outenah, Madjid
No, this one, this one is not on top of energy.
0:37:26.70 --> 0:37:30.320
Outenah, Madjid
It's it's basically using the as TP request.
0:37:34.420 --> 0:37:34.770
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah.
0:37:34.780 --> 0:37:35.930
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah, choose, yeah.
0:37:31.30 --> 0:37:37.150
Korenschi, Eduard
So you CFE API directly, so yeah, it shouldn't be a big change to just past motional parameter.
0:37:36.520 --> 0:37:43.570
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I so so sorry for interrupt and I say better or men team so I can, can you give some more context.
0:37:43.580 --> 0:37:45.750
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So I'm just joy after that.
0:37:46.60 --> 0:37:47.730
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So. So what?
0:37:47.740 --> 0:37:48.680
Khunphet, Phonlawat
What is the current issue?
0:37:52.160 --> 0:37:58.80
Outenah, Madjid
Umm well, we have an issue with the with some implementation.
0:37:58.90 --> 0:38:22.720
Outenah, Madjid
I think we have made in Seth to to query CFS for for files that given a name in a in a given bouquets or the question is the fight took a 5 set, retrieval by name is it is it part of the CFS publisher API or part of the subscriber API?
0:38:25.690 --> 0:38:26.670
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I yeah.
0:38:26.680 --> 0:38:26.900
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah.
0:38:26.910 --> 0:38:27.900
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I I yeah.
0:38:22.730 --> 0:38:28.260
Outenah, Madjid
Meaning, if I am a subscriber, can I can I query for yeah, yeah.
0:38:27.910 --> 0:38:29.640
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Let let me just confirm this one.
0:38:38.590 --> 0:38:39.30
Outenah, Madjid
OK.
0:38:29.650 --> 0:38:41.260
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So I'm so publisher and subscriber can call get visit by the verify fiset name and they must specify bucket name as well and the file name might be exactly met, yeah.
0:38:42.250 --> 0:38:44.450
Outenah, Madjid
Have to exactly match, OK yeah.
0:38:43.910 --> 0:38:45.100
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, yeah, that is known.
0:38:45.110 --> 0:38:45.760
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Partial matching.
0:38:45.770 --> 0:38:46.460
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Something like that?
0:38:46.510 --> 0:38:46.610
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah.
0:38:48.0 --> 0:38:48.220
Outenah, Madjid
OK.
0:38:48.390 --> 0:38:56.790
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So if you can give me some the full request that you said like you got the high latency so I can deep dive into that one.
0:38:58.420 --> 0:38:59.130
Outenah, Madjid
No.
0:38:59.760 --> 0:39:9.330
Outenah, Madjid
Well, I think the way we implemented in self initially, I'm not sure there was in the primary version of of CFS, whether this was existing.
0:39:15.410 --> 0:39:15.630
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah.
0:39:15.680 --> 0:39:16.710
Outenah, Madjid
Find the file setting.
0:39:23.180 --> 0:39:23.320
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah.
0:39:15.680 --> 0:39:27.600
Khunphet, Phonlawat
And I also and I can I check from the seabed lock, so I can say that you are calling get five sets and it take about less than 100 millisecond.
0:39:27.770 --> 0:39:30.740
Khunphet, Phonlawat
It didn't normally should be 60 or 70 millisecond.
0:39:31.210 --> 0:39:31.440
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah.
0:39:31.450 --> 0:39:39.450
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I don't see highlights Inc yet I check I I keep checking and still not see the issue.
0:39:39.460 --> 0:39:55.340
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, but we we need to deep dive into the specific request that you mentioned because it might be like a network issue because you know right when you connect to save it need to go into the ADB gateway and then add gateway forward to save it at the back end.
0:39:55.630 --> 0:39:59.620
Khunphet, Phonlawat
There are multiple companies behind the scene and along the way, right?
0:40:0.390 --> 0:40:0.700
Outenah, Madjid
Mm-hmm.
0:39:59.770 --> 0:40:7.530
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So we need to understand whether the issue coming from CBI all is coming from along the way.
0:40:7.660 --> 0:40:10.490
Khunphet, Phonlawat
OK, it it happened for other component.
0:40:10.760 --> 0:40:15.700
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, that, that, that's why I act the specific quite right.
0:40:17.860 --> 0:40:18.140
Outenah, Madjid
OK.
0:40:23.920 --> 0:40:32.630
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Because I also not normally the the slow net of the save it my related to database but when I look into the debit everything looking fine.
0:40:33.140 --> 0:40:34.750
Khunphet, Phonlawat
There is no high CPU set.
0:40:34.960 --> 0:40:37.960
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, there is no highlighting something like that.
0:40:38.260 --> 0:40:38.650
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, that.
0:40:38.660 --> 0:40:40.820
Khunphet, Phonlawat
That's why I need a specific one.
0:40:40.290 --> 0:40:44.940
Korenschi, Eduard
But I think we can stop with a too much investigator on this front.
0:40:44.950 --> 0:41:2.270
Korenschi, Eduard
So the the the issue is that we have this bucket with a very large number of file set inside it and the main issue is that uh, the way that on the client side the search for a file that was implemented was by retrieving the whole bucket.
0:41:4.950 --> 0:41:8.490
Outenah, Madjid
OK. OK.
0:41:2.920 --> 0:41:9.840
Korenschi, Eduard
All the files that's in the bucket and the fact that those calls take a little bit more, yeah.
0:41:9.520 --> 0:41:14.390
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah, so, so so you are using the get get file set from self yeah.
0:41:15.410 --> 0:41:15.790
Korenschi, Eduard
Yes, yes.
0:41:16.400 --> 0:41:19.350
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah, I guess I I may have an explanation.
0:41:19.360 --> 0:41:23.400
Outenah, Madjid
I need to confirm because this get file set is a is meant for.
0:41:25.250 --> 0:41:32.680
Outenah, Madjid
Not not for checking file set but it it it also create the file set if it does not exist.
0:41:32.690 --> 0:41:45.70
Outenah, Madjid
So the logic of this method is OK you call a get 5 set, we verify if the file settings exist, and the way to verify is is is likely iterating.
0:41:46.680 --> 0:41:51.460
Outenah, Madjid
But so I'm not sure if there is a new call which which allows to.
0:41:57.920 --> 0:41:58.80
Korenschi, Eduard
Yes.
0:41:53.590 --> 0:41:58.400
Outenah, Madjid
To directly get to have a query for that file set and and get it returned.
0:41:59.190 --> 0:42:1.200
Outenah, Madjid
But it it again.
0:42:1.210 --> 0:42:7.530
Outenah, Madjid
So we implemented the several years ago this method, so it made it made it made it didn't existed at that time.
0:42:8.510 --> 0:42:22.80
Outenah, Madjid
So The thing is that if it is the case and I I guess the action is for me to escalate to my development team and verify if that is the case, we will have to implement a new method.
0:42:23.470 --> 0:42:32.170
Outenah, Madjid
That's just a check five if if a file set exist or update this one so that uh so that.
0:42:34.240 --> 0:42:43.90
Outenah, Madjid
Uh, if there is a new way to query CFS which is more optimal than than iterating, because format I can see in the code and it seems saturating.
0:42:44.990 --> 0:42:45.240
Outenah, Madjid
Uh.
0:42:45.220 --> 0:42:45.870
Khunphet, Phonlawat
And the chair.
0:42:45.600 --> 0:42:46.730
Outenah, Madjid
Then we looked at it.
0:42:45.880 --> 0:42:46.910
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Can I share my skin?
0:42:46.960 --> 0:42:51.850
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Care to share my screen so I can give some more information?
0:42:54.350 --> 0:42:54.490
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah.
0:42:52.0 --> 0:42:55.350
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Not sure it's are here or not, but let let let me know if you see my screen.
0:42:55.930 --> 0:42:57.250
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah, we can see it yet.
0:42:56.950 --> 0:43:0.840
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Can you confirm that the request coming from US is 1 right?
0:43:1.210 --> 0:43:2.420
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I mean the in the.
0:43:1.760 --> 0:43:2.430
Outenah, Madjid
Yes.
0:43:2.480 --> 0:43:2.870
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah.
0:43:2.670 --> 0:43:3.640
Khunphet, Phonlawat
OK, OK.
0:43:2.920 --> 0:43:4.310
Outenah, Madjid
Yes, yes, yes.
0:43:4.320 --> 0:43:6.700
Outenah, Madjid
Just one, yeah.
0:43:3.790 --> 0:43:9.990
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So I'm checking from the not working yet and if you can confirm that this is the two user that we are looking for, right?
0:43:12.880 --> 0:43:13.300
Khunphet, Phonlawat
That's it.
0:43:13.410 --> 0:43:15.290
Outenah, Madjid
All right, uh.
0:43:13.360 --> 0:43:16.850
Khunphet, Phonlawat
This is correct 1460 T 14604.
0:43:20.380 --> 0:43:20.610
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
You.
0:43:18.630 --> 0:43:20.980
Outenah, Madjid
I don't remember, so Siri, is it the one?
0:43:22.320 --> 0:43:23.320
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
Yes, that's the one.
0:43:24.270 --> 0:43:24.530
Outenah, Madjid
OK.
0:43:24.520 --> 0:43:25.390
Khunphet, Phonlawat
OK, OK.
0:43:25.400 --> 0:43:38.450
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So when I take a look right, I'm using a I'm looking for one day and I using the duration first so it will do the descending order so you can see that the maximum latency is 600 millisecond.
0:43:40.140 --> 0:43:42.620
Khunphet, Phonlawat
You can see right and that is some umm.
0:43:59.840 --> 0:44:0.80
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Umm.
0:44:9.990 --> 0:44:10.200
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Umm.
0:43:40.640 --> 0:44:14.440
Korenschi, Eduard
Yeah, we, we we, we've seen that on the previous logs that we have seen on the screen about this durations and these are a little bit more than you are expected because also because probably this pagination or very large data set, yeah that probably some hundreds of file sets in there and in order to retrieve all that it actually they are just going and requesting it page by page and probably you add some additional time doing during that pagination when we are trying to retrieve a very specific file set by giving the bucket and the file.
0:44:14.560 --> 0:44:15.110
Korenschi, Eduard
Set name.
0:44:15.620 --> 0:44:20.910
Korenschi, Eduard
So it's again by file set name not by its ID, but the bucket appear bucket and fileset name.
0:44:20.920 --> 0:44:25.270
Korenschi, Eduard
It takes like a under 100 milliseconds and which is I understand is the standard.
0:44:26.20 --> 0:44:30.270
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So you mean like you have to face the whole file set in the bucket right?
0:44:30.280 --> 0:44:30.790
Khunphet, Phonlawat
From what?
0:44:30.800 --> 0:44:37.290
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Understanding but and the total time it takes so long but it take a look for the individual should be fine, right?
0:44:38.40 --> 0:44:39.40
Korenschi, Eduard
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
0:44:39.50 --> 0:44:40.120
Korenschi, Eduard
You it looks OK.
0:44:37.530 --> 0:44:51.970
Khunphet, Phonlawat
But you are and and and and and what it appears side that you are using when you are when you call get fileset and can you please confirm if you do not specify it will determine defy.
0:44:52.260 --> 0:44:55.430
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So we recommend client to you one hundred 108.
0:44:55.440 --> 0:45:11.340
Khunphet, Phonlawat
The maximum page size and if you 100 pesos right, it will save the IT you will connect call the fiset less time because for example you have 1000 you have 100 per page right you call 10 time right?
0:45:11.700 --> 0:45:19.930
Khunphet, Phonlawat
But if you specify if you don't specify if you 20, so you can call 40 time that that it quite different.
0:45:20.0 --> 0:45:22.720
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So what would the current precise that you are using?
0:45:25.680 --> 0:45:26.640
Outenah, Madjid
Sorry. What's what?
0:45:26.650 --> 0:45:29.60
Outenah, Madjid
What is your question you?
0:45:28.160 --> 0:45:34.290
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I mean, I mean in the in, in the case file set right get five sets that is the attribute called page site.
0:45:34.610 --> 0:45:36.490
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So maybe I can show you one thing.
0:45:36.580 --> 0:45:46.90
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So we can take a look on the save it so I could API and if I go to the fileset right, this is the all fileset and that is the piece site.
0:45:46.140 --> 0:45:47.510
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Let me Scroll down.
0:45:47.740 --> 0:45:50.570
Khunphet, Phonlawat
You can see right the if you don't have a defy it will you?
0:45:50.580 --> 0:45:58.10
Khunphet, Phonlawat
25 so with the command, if you have to get more data, so you need to use one hundred 108, the maximum.
0:45:58.20 --> 0:46:0.380
Khunphet, Phonlawat
If you don't specify it, you 25 for default value.
0:46:1.970 --> 0:46:3.790
Outenah, Madjid
For the batch size, OK, don't.
0:46:3.800 --> 0:46:5.940
Outenah, Madjid
I don't know what's what value we are specifying.
0:46:5.30 --> 0:46:6.690
Khunphet, Phonlawat
We need 100.
0:46:6.700 --> 0:46:9.290
Khunphet, Phonlawat
We will speed up a recommend you, you, you.
0:46:9.300 --> 0:46:12.10
Khunphet, Phonlawat
You can try if you if you don't specify you try.
0:46:13.170 --> 0:46:13.480
Outenah, Madjid
OK.
0:46:13.490 --> 0:46:14.960
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah, you may see it in the corner.
0:46:14.970 --> 0:46:22.390
Outenah, Madjid
You are not able to see in the call of if in your page where you're logging the time stamps where you get the queries, do you have it?
0:46:23.50 --> 0:46:23.420
Outenah, Madjid
Is it?
0:46:23.870 --> 0:46:24.650
Outenah, Madjid
You may see what?
0:46:24.330 --> 0:46:26.420
Khunphet, Phonlawat
You you mean some from my side, right?
0:46:26.980 --> 0:46:27.960
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah, in the message.
0:46:28.100 --> 0:46:30.710
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Uh, yeah, yeah, I have seen that. 25.
0:46:31.840 --> 0:46:32.20
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah.
0:46:30.720 --> 0:46:33.890
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, pretty sure need to be increased.
0:46:33.900 --> 0:46:34.50
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah.
0:46:38.160 --> 0:46:40.70
Outenah, Madjid
This is yes.
0:46:34.800 --> 0:46:40.130
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Are you are calling the if RTS double output right? Yeah.
0:46:40.80 --> 0:46:41.760
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah, that's that's a big get, you know.
0:46:42.550 --> 0:46:43.280
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yes, Pete.
0:46:43.290 --> 0:46:44.460
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Pete. Pete, try.
0:46:44.530 --> 0:46:45.510
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I highly recommend.
0:46:47.400 --> 0:46:47.610
Outenah, Madjid
To.
0:46:46.350 --> 0:46:48.430
Khunphet, Phonlawat
It will submit a Fordham, I believe.
0:46:49.840 --> 0:46:53.370
Outenah, Madjid
How much you said can you 200 or or?
0:46:56.230 --> 0:46:56.490
Outenah, Madjid
OK.
0:46:51.750 --> 0:47:0.160
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I mean I I I mean it, it will reduce four time that you have to get the data and give you an example right.
0:47:0.880 --> 0:47:2.680
Outenah, Madjid
You know, OK.
0:47:0.270 --> 0:47:6.90
Khunphet, Phonlawat
If you have 1000 right, you only call 1010 time instead of 40 time, yeah.
0:47:7.400 --> 0:47:7.740
Outenah, Madjid
OK.
0:47:10.750 --> 0:47:13.760
Outenah, Madjid
OK, OK. So.
0:47:19.890 --> 0:47:20.410
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
100.
0:47:18.970 --> 0:47:20.480
Khunphet, Phonlawat
One hundred 101.
0:47:16.540 --> 0:47:21.650
Outenah, Madjid
What is the maximum value for this for this page type one 100.
0:47:21.690 --> 0:47:22.110
Outenah, Madjid
OK.
0:47:23.110 --> 0:47:23.220
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yes.
0:47:22.120 --> 0:47:23.680
Outenah, Madjid
So we'll put it to 100.
0:47:25.440 --> 0:47:26.230
N U, Chandu (External)
Sorry.
0:47:26.790 --> 0:47:41.590
N U, Chandu (External)
See, we have one more request for our to start a TRT for RFR, saying that TRT for terms Sonia and RFR, we have multiple mismatch between the price per and RFR is the same thing in shame issue which is discussing here.
0:47:44.50 --> 0:47:45.150
Klajko, Robert (External)
No, it's a different.
0:47:46.320 --> 0:47:46.650
N U, Chandu (External)
OK.
0:47:46.570 --> 0:47:46.900
Flagg, Todd
I've got.
0:47:46.660 --> 0:47:48.90
N U, Chandu (External)
Should we start the different TRT then?
0:47:48.890 --> 0:47:50.110
Flagg, Todd
Should I got it?
0:47:50.240 --> 0:47:50.510
Klajko, Robert (External)
O,.
0:47:52.660 --> 0:47:53.80
Klajko, Robert (External)
Not sure.
0:47:55.0 --> 0:47:55.390
N U, Chandu (External)
I should.
0:47:54.810 --> 0:47:56.500
Flagg, Todd
So this is new to me.
0:47:57.440 --> 0:47:57.650
N U, Chandu (External)
No.
0:47:58.170 --> 0:48:1.710
Flagg, Todd
We've got a problem if we got a separate problem on the pricer.
0:48:2.950 --> 0:48:3.200
N U, Chandu (External)
Yeah.
0:48:3.210 --> 0:48:11.540
N U, Chandu (External)
And also there will be 2 is not big cable being calculated and the TWB file books us looks to be missing on UI.
0:48:14.920 --> 0:48:15.230
Flagg, Todd
OK.
0:48:17.480 --> 0:48:17.740
N U, Chandu (External)
OK.
0:48:17.750 --> 0:48:19.220
N U, Chandu (External)
Well, I'll start a different here then.
0:48:21.180 --> 0:48:21.540
N U, Chandu (External)
Let's see.
0:48:22.510 --> 0:48:22.680
Flagg, Todd
Yeah.
0:48:23.60 --> 0:48:29.260
Klajko, Robert (External)
Well, so OK, but the but the RR team is here in this meeting, so.
0:48:30.70 --> 0:48:30.580
Flagg, Todd
Yeah.
0:48:30.90 --> 0:48:31.250
N U, Chandu (External)
How do we deal with this then?
0:48:31.160 --> 0:48:31.290
Outenah, Madjid
But.
0:48:30.670 --> 0:48:32.620
Flagg, Todd
So, Sergei, can you do me a favor?
0:48:32.890 --> 0:48:33.110
N U, Chandu (External)
Yeah.
0:48:32.690 --> 0:48:35.800
Flagg, Todd
Like you probably know that better than anyone surgery.
0:48:35.810 --> 0:48:36.810
Flagg, Todd
Can you jump over to that call?
0:48:41.570 --> 0:48:41.800
N U, Chandu (External)
Yeah.
0:48:41.630 --> 0:48:42.110
Flagg, Todd
But thank you.
0:48:38.60 --> 0:48:42.510
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Ohh yeah, but where I can take a link?
0:48:41.810 --> 0:48:42.800
N U, Chandu (External)
Give you a couple of minutes.
0:48:44.70 --> 0:48:44.750
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Uh-huh, sure.
0:48:42.810 --> 0:48:45.940
N U, Chandu (External)
Let me start the TRT 1st and I'll share the details.
0:48:47.170 --> 0:48:47.370
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
OK.
0:48:47.10 --> 0:48:48.570
N U, Chandu (External)
OK. OK.
0:48:48.580 --> 0:48:48.850
N U, Chandu (External)
Thank you.
0:49:1.360 --> 0:49:2.400
Flagg, Todd
And I hate to say this like.
0:49:2.230 --> 0:49:2.560
Outenah, Madjid
OK.
0:49:4.60 --> 0:49:6.550
Flagg, Todd
Uh, sorry, who's the the L2 for?
0:49:6.560 --> 0:49:10.390
Flagg, Todd
CFS, like that's probably who needs to be on that call that's being raised.
0:49:14.810 --> 0:49:15.840
Flagg, Todd
I don't really.
0:49:15.930 --> 0:49:16.300
Flagg, Todd
I don't know.
0:49:16.350 --> 0:49:19.270
Flagg, Todd
May end up having to just wrap wrap these those two calls together.
0:49:21.210 --> 0:49:21.750
Flagg, Todd
Ah.
0:49:20.310 --> 0:49:24.700
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Let let let me let me ask someone in the AL 2 for CS.
0:49:25.720 --> 0:49:25.900
Flagg, Todd
OK.
0:49:26.930 --> 0:49:29.580
Khunphet, Phonlawat
But, but I think we we don't have them right in the email.
0:49:29.830 --> 0:49:30.960
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Did you tap them in the email?
0:49:32.940 --> 0:49:33.690
Flagg, Todd
I don't know.
0:49:33.840 --> 0:49:36.890
Flagg, Todd
I'll be honest with you, with this I was more focused on this issue initially.
0:49:38.210 --> 0:49:39.700
Flagg, Todd
Umm, I'd have to go back to our.
0:49:38.80 --> 0:49:40.190
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, maybe I I will put a I.
0:49:43.300 --> 0:49:43.480
Flagg, Todd
It's.
0:49:40.360 --> 0:49:45.210
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, I will put the email in the chat 1st and I will I will parallelly.
0:49:45.440 --> 0:49:46.380
Khunphet, Phonlawat
OK, wait a moment.
0:49:47.230 --> 0:49:47.480
Flagg, Todd
Sure.
0:49:51.580 --> 0:49:51.780
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah.
0:49:46.360 --> 0:49:51.780
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
Yeah, there's no no circle level for umm.
0:49:51.940 --> 0:49:54.140
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
They passed in the in the mail, yeah.
0:49:54.790 --> 0:49:55.10
Flagg, Todd
OK.
0:49:54.560 --> 0:49:56.500
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, that should be the recovery manager, right?
0:49:56.510 --> 0:49:57.290
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, should be auto.
0:49:57.190 --> 0:49:57.410
Flagg, Todd
Yep.
0:49:57.300 --> 0:49:57.830
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, I said.
0:49:57.840 --> 0:49:58.530
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I said in the chat.
0:49:58.540 --> 0:50:0.440
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, maybe someone you can reach out.
0:49:59.60 --> 0:50:4.520
Miller, Laurence
OK, so so if you don't you, what's, what's the talk about a second call for service?
0:50:4.530 --> 0:50:10.350
Miller, Laurence
Is it something else from service or they just breaking off to have a more of a specific conversation about CFS?
0:50:11.140 --> 0:50:24.320
Flagg, Todd
So we just got another email in on term on another rate within RFR today saying that there was missing data and there is some pricing mismatch which makes sense if those missing data.
0:50:27.370 --> 0:50:35.900
Flagg, Todd
So there's, it seems to be a completely separate issue to this, though this is all on this TRT is all on the slowness that we're seeing whenever we're trying to pull the data.
0:50:35.270 --> 0:50:36.710
Miller, Laurence
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
0:50:38.120 --> 0:50:40.0
Flagg, Todd
I'm not clear what's going.
0:50:42.960 --> 0:50:43.120
Flagg, Todd
Yeah.
0:50:42.570 --> 0:50:45.240
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Yes, I can see input files is missing for L2.
0:50:45.250 --> 0:50:47.810
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
So now this is absolutely separate issue.
0:50:50.130 --> 0:50:50.530
Flagg, Todd
So.
0:50:53.540 --> 0:50:57.190
Flagg, Todd
If the files are missing, does that mean they brokered and actually contribute them?
0:50:57.860 --> 0:51:2.650
Flagg, Todd
I hope rather than we're just not able to process them or is this another?
0:50:59.810 --> 0:51:4.280
Miller, Laurence
But I'm sorry, it's not nothing to do with the performance.
0:51:5.10 --> 0:51:5.380
Flagg, Todd
Correct.
0:51:4.290 --> 0:51:6.790
Miller, Laurence
Hasn't stopped some of them coming through and on that though, is it?
0:51:7.610 --> 0:51:9.60
Flagg, Todd
No, but I mean this.
0:51:9.130 --> 0:51:13.980
Flagg, Todd
I got historical bias here, but like that broker has, I think that's the broker, right?
0:51:13.990 --> 0:51:21.590
Flagg, Todd
That's submitted files before with like wild characters in it and stuff like that, so they didn't get processed by certain processes.
0:51:25.230 --> 0:51:25.840
Flagg, Todd
I don't know.
0:51:26.20 --> 0:51:27.240
Flagg, Todd
It's a separate TRT.
0:51:27.250 --> 0:51:27.700
Flagg, Todd
Maybe I'll.
0:51:27.710 --> 0:51:29.660
Flagg, Todd
I'll let the I'll let them investigate it.
0:51:30.510 --> 0:51:34.320
Flagg, Todd
I don't know why the files aren't there or they're not getting processed.
0:51:35.780 --> 0:51:39.740
Miller, Laurence
Right, that, that one's actually actually an actual incident.
0:51:39.750 --> 0:51:40.760
Miller, Laurence
So to speak, though, yeah, no.
0:51:41.420 --> 0:51:41.940
Flagg, Todd
Hmm.
0:51:43.150 --> 0:51:46.340
Miller, Laurence
But whereas this one sort of trying to avoid an incident more or less, don't we?
0:51:51.510 --> 0:51:52.60
Flagg, Todd
Yeah, that's fair.
0:51:55.270 --> 0:51:58.750
Miller, Laurence
That ones, there's a TFT being spun up for that one as well.
0:51:58.760 --> 0:51:59.950
Miller, Laurence
Are you TRT?
0:51:59.670 --> 0:52:0.30
Flagg, Todd
Correct.
0:51:59.960 --> 0:52:1.630
Miller, Laurence
Sorry, what?
0:52:7.990 --> 0:52:8.280
Korenschi, Eduard
Do you?
0:52:7.350 --> 0:52:8.740
Miller, Laurence
What's the impact of the other one?
0:52:8.750 --> 0:52:10.470
Miller, Laurence
I mean, obviously there's this.
0:52:10.480 --> 0:52:11.580
Miller, Laurence
Indictment everybody's that.
0:52:12.320 --> 0:52:13.850
Miller, Laurence
Is that something's gotta be corrected.
0:52:13.860 --> 0:52:16.880
Miller, Laurence
Is it something that's they've not been able to send out or what? What's?
0:52:17.900 --> 0:52:18.910
Flagg, Todd
Yeah, let me.
0:52:22.590 --> 0:52:25.280
Flagg, Todd
And today, thank you for highlighting that so Lawrence.
0:52:28.760 --> 0:52:30.830
Klajko, Robert (External)
I think that, yeah.
0:52:28.460 --> 0:52:35.750
Flagg, Todd
So they just published it manually, so is what I see from the message you suspended.
0:52:42.490 --> 0:52:43.220
Flagg, Todd
I mean, yeah, sorry.
0:52:43.230 --> 0:52:45.540
Flagg, Todd
It's like the quick note is this.
0:52:45.550 --> 0:52:47.850
Flagg, Todd
Lawrence is basically they pause the call.
0:52:47.930 --> 0:52:51.530
Flagg, Todd
They basically keep they kept it from being automatically published this morning.
0:52:53.50 --> 0:52:54.120
Flagg, Todd
They're requesting the TRT.
0:52:55.240 --> 0:52:55.960
Flagg, Todd
Umm.
0:52:56.440 --> 0:52:57.520
Flagg, Todd
Sergei basically said.
0:52:59.540 --> 0:53:1.10
Flagg, Todd
A file is not been received it.
0:53:1.20 --> 0:53:1.870
Flagg, Todd
Am I wrong on that one?
0:53:1.880 --> 0:53:9.20
Flagg, Todd
Sergei Ohm and for some reason, they've and basically they, they have a way of publishing this manually, Lawrence.
0:53:9.110 --> 0:53:11.960
Miller, Laurence
But the suppose the client is concerned they got what they needed.
0:53:12.270 --> 0:53:14.940
Miller, Laurence
We just need to work out why it didn't work in the way we expected it to.
0:53:15.830 --> 0:53:16.250
Flagg, Todd
Exactly.
0:53:17.150 --> 0:53:17.780
Miller, Laurence
But thanks.
0:53:17.790 --> 0:53:18.300
Miller, Laurence
Thanks dot.
0:53:18.860 --> 0:53:19.40
Flagg, Todd
Yep.
0:53:25.710 --> 0:53:31.210
Flagg, Todd
So maybe I'm let me pop over to that other call real quick. Umm.
0:53:34.450 --> 0:53:36.630
Flagg, Todd
When it rains, it pours, right, OK.
0:53:36.570 --> 0:53:39.590
Korenschi, Eduard
But do we need this call anymore or what's the follow up?
0:53:40.650 --> 0:53:42.100
Flagg, Todd
Yeah, I mean, I guess that's what I wanted.
0:53:42.110 --> 0:53:47.880
Flagg, Todd
I think that's what we're just still missing, right, is I I'd like to get some defined actions that we actually have to do.
0:53:48.50 --> 0:53:49.370
Flagg, Todd
So I can check them off the list.
0:53:50.990 --> 0:53:52.260
Flagg, Todd
I've got a whole list of them.
0:53:52.270 --> 0:53:55.80
Flagg, Todd
Internally, we need to look into Edward.
0:53:55.440 --> 0:54:1.980
Flagg, Todd
Umm, but that might be beside the point, but what's the specific actions we need to kind of take from this call?
0:54:3.600 --> 0:54:3.900
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I think.
0:54:3.230 --> 0:54:5.420
Korenschi, Eduard
So I think we're all on one on one front.
0:54:5.430 --> 0:54:6.630
Korenschi, Eduard
It's gonna be multiple fronts.
0:54:6.640 --> 0:54:6.860
Korenschi, Eduard
We can.
0:54:6.870 --> 0:54:8.820
Korenschi, Eduard
We can actually take out CFS from this.
0:54:10.700 --> 0:54:12.730
Korenschi, Eduard
Moment on one on the 1 front.
0:54:12.980 --> 0:54:27.170
Korenschi, Eduard
Magic and the Dev team on the self should look as how soon they can do some sort of other implementation, either as a different function or improving this one so that they changed the algorithm of looking up for file sets.
0:54:27.540 --> 0:54:35.500
Korenschi, Eduard
And separately, we will look up into using the ID library directly to look up the file set without going through the self API.
0:54:37.730 --> 0:54:38.80
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah.
0:54:38.90 --> 0:54:43.560
Outenah, Madjid
So yes, I think that's the first one will be very temporary issue.
0:54:43.610 --> 0:54:46.210
Outenah, Madjid
Temporary solution for you.
0:54:47.380 --> 0:54:53.190
Outenah, Madjid
Uh to to try to use to look for the file set directly using your Dileep.
0:54:53.240 --> 0:54:54.130
Outenah, Madjid
I think it should be.
0:54:54.180 --> 0:54:55.310
Outenah, Madjid
It should be possible.
0:54:55.980 --> 0:55:1.500
Outenah, Madjid
I will double check with with the LCD team if they can provide the API call.
0:55:2.660 --> 0:55:3.760
Outenah, Madjid
Uh, reference for that?
0:55:17.400 --> 0:55:17.620
Flagg, Todd
OK.
0:55:5.110 --> 0:55:18.640
Outenah, Madjid
Uh and on self, certainly we'll have to look to create another method because the method you are using is is a is also creating the file set if it does not exist and it always return it anyway.
0:55:19.510 --> 0:55:27.320
Outenah, Madjid
So that's the that was the purpose of that method is the get look if it exists and if it does not exist it creative.
0:55:29.370 --> 0:55:40.80
Outenah, Madjid
Now, if you have just one for checking and and again if this there is a new call with CFS with the body iteration, we will do it and we will increase as well the.
0:55:46.320 --> 0:55:47.80
Khunphet, Phonlawat
101 hundred.
0:55:49.800 --> 0:55:50.350
Korenschi, Eduard
Yeah.
0:55:41.730 --> 0:55:51.40
Outenah, Madjid
This pagination size 200 so that we the yeah 100 so that it could it could be more efficient.
0:55:50.360 --> 0:55:57.30
Korenschi, Eduard
Yeah, but but my my you take into account if at all this has any meaning of going further.
0:55:57.40 --> 0:55:57.700
Korenschi, Eduard
I mean we are.
0:56:6.60 --> 0:56:7.130
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah, it's a.
0:56:9.480 --> 0:56:10.190
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah.
0:55:57.710 --> 0:56:12.180
Korenschi, Eduard
We are now like in the range of multiple minutes looking up that kind of probably it's an extreme case to have so many files that, but I don't think that moving from 25 to to 100 will significantly make it usable.
0:56:10.260 --> 0:56:13.830
Outenah, Madjid
At least at least, yeah, at least it will.
0:56:13.840 --> 0:56:23.620
Outenah, Madjid
It will increase, but if there is a query we there is a query a possible query then we will we will create a new method with a with a query just to check.
0:56:24.920 --> 0:56:30.0
Outenah, Madjid
But yeah, the to me it was done this maybe three years ago.
0:56:30.10 --> 0:56:35.550
Outenah, Madjid
It was done this way I I maybe at that time the the query did was not available on CFS.
0:56:35.560 --> 0:56:37.870
Outenah, Madjid
I don't know has been done this this week.
0:56:39.470 --> 0:56:39.890
Miller, Laurence
That.
0:56:38.820 --> 0:56:40.800
Flagg, Todd
Hey, Tom, I see you raising your hand.
0:56:39.450 --> 0:56:41.730
Outenah, Madjid
Uh, yeah, yeah.
0:56:41.590 --> 0:56:42.320
McWilliams, Thomas
Hey.
0:56:42.770 --> 0:56:44.60
McWilliams, Thomas
Yeah, just say so.
0:56:48.190 --> 0:56:49.340
Flagg, Todd
Ohh OK.
0:56:44.70 --> 0:56:57.260
McWilliams, Thomas
We've just been directed into this meeting with you guys, cause we just raised the fact that the calculation for terms Sonia failed today just now, so we're about to publish manually.
0:56:57.270 --> 0:57:4.280
McWilliams, Thomas
We didn't get file from CFS into RFR well into self I guess.
0:57:10.600 --> 0:57:10.780
Flagg, Todd
Yeah.
0:57:10.790 --> 0:57:11.110
Flagg, Todd
I mean, it's.
0:57:4.390 --> 0:57:12.120
McWilliams, Thomas
So it seems coincidental, but maybe it's not just to raise that now.
0:57:12.680 --> 0:57:13.150
Flagg, Todd
Yeah.
0:57:12.260 --> 0:57:13.720
McWilliams, Thomas
And is it?
0:57:13.220 --> 0:57:14.100
Flagg, Todd
No, I appreciate it. I'm.
0:57:13.770 --> 0:57:18.500
McWilliams, Thomas
Is it to do with the delay or is it to do with another issue I don't know.
0:57:22.130 --> 0:57:28.900
Outenah, Madjid
I guess when you say if you didn't get fired from CFS to self, is it file coming from DFD?
0:57:30.830 --> 0:57:31.50
Korenschi, Eduard
Yeah.
0:57:32.0 --> 0:57:32.270
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah.
0:57:32.60 --> 0:57:32.400
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
OK.
0:57:32.450 --> 0:57:32.670
Bielecki, Magdalena
Yes.
0:57:32.410 --> 0:57:32.690
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
What time?
0:57:32.280 --> 0:57:33.470
Outenah, Madjid
So that's the input side.
0:57:33.480 --> 0:57:35.900
Outenah, Madjid
That's a different that's the input side, yeah.
0:57:34.290 --> 0:57:37.140
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Yeah, I'm checking the logs right now.
0:57:37.150 --> 0:57:41.800
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
I'm see this error that is file is missing in surface is not ready.
0:57:41.810 --> 0:57:48.820
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
I'm also checked the D file so there there is no problem with David and also in the our logs.
0:57:48.830 --> 0:57:52.180
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
I notice that is something new error.
0:57:52.250 --> 0:57:55.680
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
I don't know what is the library API we do.
0:57:57.40 --> 0:57:57.660
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Don't be.
0:57:57.590 --> 0:57:58.60
Bielecki, Magdalena
I really didn't.
0:57:57.710 --> 0:57:58.890
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
That is not available.
0:57:59.20 --> 0:58:8.320
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
I don't know what is the library and it's crashed 505 hundred 500 and after that we go the error that we couldn't connect to surface so.
0:58:8.390 --> 0:58:9.150
Outenah, Madjid
But get to it.
0:58:11.330 --> 0:58:12.160
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
That I might know.
0:58:12.170 --> 0:58:13.100
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
What is this library?
0:58:13.110 --> 0:58:16.60
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Maybe it's a part of Erdi or another self?
0:58:15.930 --> 0:58:16.440
Outenah, Madjid
Should be.
0:58:17.280 --> 0:58:24.630
Outenah, Madjid
Should be part of 30 because you are using directly the method to get the to read the file from from.
0:58:24.700 --> 0:58:29.170
Outenah, Madjid
From DFD we don't we don't provide subscriber methods.
0:58:29.180 --> 0:58:30.340
Outenah, Madjid
So. So what?
0:58:30.350 --> 0:58:34.960
Outenah, Madjid
What method I using to to to get the the GFD files?
0:58:36.770 --> 0:58:39.960
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Ohh I need to take a look and cotton and remember but it's.
0:58:39.110 --> 0:58:49.720
Outenah, Madjid
Because normally it normally you are using gardelli but because we don't provide any method for for retrieving file from, from, from from other bucket than the one we published to.
0:58:55.350 --> 0:59:2.590
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
So I'm saying that we're trying to open a Reddy, session and every time it's getting 505 hundred probably.
0:59:2.830 --> 0:59:3.150
Outenah, Madjid
O,.
0:59:2.600 --> 0:59:3.710
Khunphet, Phonlawat
How about for one bit?
0:59:3.720 --> 0:59:4.690
Khunphet, Phonlawat
How about 400?
0:59:5.720 --> 0:59:6.30
Khunphet, Phonlawat
What?
0:59:6.40 --> 0:59:6.330
Khunphet, Phonlawat
What?
0:59:6.340 --> 0:59:6.520
Khunphet, Phonlawat
What?
0:59:6.540 --> 0:59:6.890
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Does.
0:59:7.100 --> 0:59:9.530
Khunphet, Phonlawat
What are the errors saying in 400?
0:59:9.580 --> 0:59:12.150
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Can you Scroll down and move to the right hand side?
0:59:11.640 --> 0:59:12.600
Outenah, Madjid
Umm but.
0:59:15.110 --> 0:59:15.980
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Where the gateway?
0:59:16.50 --> 0:59:16.960
Khunphet, Phonlawat
No, not not, not.
0:59:17.20 --> 0:59:18.240
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Not that one to go down.
0:59:27.30 --> 0:59:27.830
Outenah, Madjid
But but it.
0:59:18.590 --> 0:59:29.50
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I think it uh below one that is a bad request, but he's at the error ID right in the middle of yours. Hmm.
0:59:31.210 --> 0:59:32.280
Khunphet, Phonlawat
We go ahead, magic.
0:59:33.100 --> 0:59:34.400
Outenah, Madjid
No, no, no, no.
0:59:34.630 --> 0:59:35.440
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Bad gateway.
0:59:35.450 --> 0:59:35.980
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
This one?
0:59:36.430 --> 0:59:37.810
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Yeah, it's, it's.
0:59:36.710 --> 0:59:40.780
Khunphet, Phonlawat
And I I need to see the 400 foot can can you.
0:59:40.790 --> 0:59:48.320
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Can you just UM and not sure I can take a screen that need to check the what is the error message?
0:59:49.130 --> 0:59:53.150
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Or maybe you can paste it in or send file in the chat.
0:59:54.650 --> 0:59:56.40
Flagg, Todd
Are you looking for the transaction ID?
0:59:57.160 --> 0:59:59.380
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, yeah, there is a ID you can see right there is.
0:59:58.720 --> 1:0:1.830
Flagg, Todd
Yeah, see the event detail, there's your transaction ID, right?
1:0:3.110 --> 1:0:3.840
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Not that one.
1:0:4.270 --> 1:0:5.190
Khunphet, Phonlawat
That is another one.
1:0:6.70 --> 1:0:7.460
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Can you Scroll down a little bit?
1:0:7.470 --> 1:0:9.360
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Maybe I will capture and send in the chat.
1:0:9.630 --> 1:0:11.160
Khunphet, Phonlawat
You can see what I'm looking for.
1:0:11.690 --> 1:0:12.360
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Wait a moment.
1:0:12.750 --> 1:0:13.100
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Hold on.
1:0:13.110 --> 1:0:14.260
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Hold on this one.
1:0:14.710 --> 1:0:19.840
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I will paid in the chat and this one so you can see that I highlight right.
1:0:20.130 --> 1:0:20.830
Khunphet, Phonlawat
It's gonna show.
1:0:22.780 --> 1:0:23.850
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, I sent in the chat.
1:0:24.20 --> 1:0:26.980
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So can you move to the right hand side update line?
1:0:26.520 --> 1:0:29.830
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
No, no, I I can't see your chat at all.
1:0:29.840 --> 1:0:34.300
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
I don't know why it's not showing chat for me that is no chat window.
1:0:35.890 --> 1:0:36.120
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Uh.
1:0:33.830 --> 1:0:37.570
Klajko, Robert (External)
Yeah, there, there is no chance for me for me either.
1:0:39.720 --> 1:0:40.530
Khunphet, Phonlawat
You think you are?
1:0:40.540 --> 1:0:41.380
Khunphet, Phonlawat
You are not.
1:0:40.230 --> 1:0:42.350
N U, Chandu (External)
Let me try to add you in the chat.
1:0:42.730 --> 1:0:44.20
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
What is the line number?
1:0:44.270 --> 1:0:44.790
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Could you say?
1:0:44.850 --> 1:0:45.780
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I'm like, OK.
1:0:45.790 --> 1:0:46.30
Khunphet, Phonlawat
OK.
1:0:46.40 --> 1:0:46.340
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Thank.
1:0:46.350 --> 1:0:47.80
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Thanks for one.
1:0:47.130 --> 1:0:49.950
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Uh 767767.
1:0:52.110 --> 1:0:53.340
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Seven. OK.
1:0:50.620 --> 1:0:53.840
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
767 years listen, OK? Yeah.
1:0:53.350 --> 1:0:55.770
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, that, that, that either line number, OK.
1:0:56.580 --> 1:0:56.870
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Uh-huh.
1:0:58.600 --> 1:1:0.550
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Say fashion world request.
1:1:0.880 --> 1:1:2.800
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
I'll set has no files.
1:1:2.830 --> 1:1:3.50
Miller, Laurence
Good.
1:1:1.970 --> 1:1:5.10
Khunphet, Phonlawat
And also can you can you be chat that you UID?
1:1:10.280 --> 1:1:11.550
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
I did this one ID.
1:1:9.290 --> 1:1:14.710
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Our username that you are using, the user ID or the U ID.
1:1:13.770 --> 1:1:14.870
Flagg, Todd
The machine idea, right?
1:1:15.100 --> 1:1:16.380
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, yeah, the machine ID.
1:1:14.270 --> 1:1:17.860
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
As say user data using here machine ID.
1:1:19.110 --> 1:1:19.620
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, yeah.
1:1:18.50 --> 1:1:19.720
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
OK, let me try to find it.
1:1:19.710 --> 1:1:24.220
Khunphet, Phonlawat
From from my side we we we are we are calling my you user ID or UID.
1:1:36.70 --> 1:1:36.470
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
This one.
1:1:45.250 --> 1:1:45.970
Miller, Laurence
Because obviously there.
1:1:43.880 --> 1:1:46.320
Khunphet, Phonlawat
And you are are you able to send in the chat?
1:1:47.940 --> 1:1:48.160
Miller, Laurence
Yeah.
1:1:47.400 --> 1:1:48.230
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Now I can't.
1:1:48.240 --> 1:1:49.300
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
I don't have a chat window.
1:1:49.980 --> 1:1:52.490
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Can someone can you the permission?
1:1:52.500 --> 1:1:53.200
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I think you are.
1:1:58.430 --> 1:1:58.690
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Maybe.
1:1:55.440 --> 1:1:58.970
Khunphet, Phonlawat
You are missing the permission so that you won't be able to see the chat.
1:2:0.530 --> 1:2:3.140
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Need someone to add you into their TRT channel.
1:2:3.220 --> 1:2:4.760
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I think I have seen.
1:2:4.150 --> 1:2:5.10
N U, Chandu (External)
Yeah, just added.
1:2:8.480 --> 1:2:9.180
N U, Chandu (External)
I just added him.
1:2:10.30 --> 1:2:13.970
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
My eyes should reconnect, cause still the same.
1:2:16.170 --> 1:2:18.630
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
You'll let me try to rejoin the call.
1:2:19.560 --> 1:2:22.780
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Or if you are able to send, maybe you can send into OK.
1:2:26.810 --> 1:2:29.100
RP, Sandeep (External)
Though I sorry for the interruption.
1:2:29.850 --> 1:2:33.630
RP, Sandeep (External)
Ohh what is the action required from electron FLS?
1:2:38.620 --> 1:2:44.610
RP, Sandeep (External)
I see a TRT request came and looked to this TRT.
1:2:46.460 --> 1:2:48.140
N U, Chandu (External)
That's the different day.
1:2:50.610 --> 1:2:50.810
N U, Chandu (External)
Yeah.
1:2:46.520 --> 1:2:54.630
Miller, Laurence
Yeah, I think there was a I think I think there was a separate TRT request raised to investigate this particular, but we've ended up with it all on this one.
1:2:55.120 --> 1:3:10.970
Miller, Laurence
But we do need to make sure there's a separate incident for the other, for the for the that's being looked at right now, because there's there's two different things ones to do with the performance, which was the original reason this TRT was raised and wanted to do with the missing file, which is, which we've sort of moved into at the moment.
1:3:10.980 --> 1:3:13.320
Miller, Laurence
We do need to make sure there's two separate incidents raised.
1:3:15.120 --> 1:3:15.320
RP, Sandeep (External)
OK.
1:3:15.390 --> 1:3:16.70
RP, Sandeep (External)
Yeah.
1:3:16.160 --> 1:3:19.990
RP, Sandeep (External)
Ohh who is going to raise the incident?
1:3:21.500 --> 1:3:23.870
N U, Chandu (External)
And whether the already raised I think the email is also sent.
1:3:24.890 --> 1:3:25.560
RP, Sandeep (External)
OK.
1:3:25.850 --> 1:3:28.20
RP, Sandeep (External)
Also, we need a separate.
1:3:26.710 --> 1:3:28.320
Miller, Laurence
We've got, we've already have.
1:3:28.330 --> 1:3:29.120
Miller, Laurence
We heard fine.
1:3:29.130 --> 1:3:29.830
Miller, Laurence
If we've got already.
1:3:31.190 --> 1:3:32.800
RP, Sandeep (External)
Yeah, we need a separate TRT.
1:3:32.810 --> 1:3:33.630
RP, Sandeep (External)
Four uh.
1:3:33.640 --> 1:3:34.970
RP, Sandeep (External)
This Sonia, right?
1:3:37.520 --> 1:3:38.720
Flagg, Todd
Well, we're all on here right now.
1:3:36.410 --> 1:3:38.880
Miller, Laurence
But at the moment, at the moment it's been looked at right here.
1:3:38.890 --> 1:3:39.600
Miller, Laurence
So there's the.
1:3:39.610 --> 1:3:41.90
Miller, Laurence
Let's stay where we are for now, yeah.
1:3:41.550 --> 1:3:44.900
Flagg, Todd
Yeah, we have all the necessary people already on this call, so.
1:3:45.330 --> 1:3:50.150
Miller, Laurence
That's why someone's just flipped the the the, the the incident reference up on the end, the chat.
1:3:50.100 --> 1:3:50.470
McWilliams, Thomas
Yeah.
1:3:50.480 --> 1:3:50.910
McWilliams, Thomas
I just.
1:3:50.980 --> 1:3:52.80
McWilliams, Thomas
I just pinged it in the chat.
1:3:52.320 --> 1:3:52.660
Miller, Laurence
Thank you.
1:3:55.840 --> 1:3:56.560
Miller, Laurence
Missing fall.
1:3:52.90 --> 1:3:57.10
McWilliams, Thomas
That's for the one that we just got raised for the the missing file incident.
1:3:56.570 --> 1:3:57.40
Miller, Laurence
Yeah.
1:3:57.60 --> 1:3:57.780
McWilliams, Thomas
Yeah.
1:3:57.650 --> 1:3:57.970
Miller, Laurence
Thank you.
1:4:0.240 --> 1:4:6.80
Miller, Laurence
Just so we make sure that they're both tracked accordingly because they're Sai different, different, different things.
1:4:9.890 --> 1:4:10.510
RP, Sandeep (External)
So this.
1:4:12.550 --> 1:4:14.20
RP, Sandeep (External)
Ohh it is it.
1:4:14.70 --> 1:4:20.190
RP, Sandeep (External)
Sonia and Darif or these are both are different, right or?
1:4:27.110 --> 1:4:27.470
RP, Sandeep (External)
OK.
1:4:27.890 --> 1:4:28.90
Miller, Laurence
Yeah.
1:4:20.960 --> 1:4:28.750
Flagg, Todd
They're all part of the same app, like they're individual services that are running uh under the same application.
1:4:30.660 --> 1:4:33.10
Miller, Laurence
The same the same application, two different incidents.
1:4:34.570 --> 1:4:34.890
RP, Sandeep (External)
OK.
1:4:37.690 --> 1:4:38.220
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
You know the.
1:4:36.420 --> 1:4:39.880
RP, Sandeep (External)
Like any any, anything to check from electron?
1:4:42.170 --> 1:4:43.110
Flagg, Todd
At this point in time now.
1:4:44.330 --> 1:4:44.650
RP, Sandeep (External)
OK.
1:4:47.360 --> 1:4:50.290
RP, Sandeep (External)
I'll be an old please speak English.
1:4:50.60 --> 1:4:50.310
Miller, Laurence
OK.
1:4:50.350 --> 1:4:51.790
RP, Sandeep (External)
Anything like.
1:4:57.940 --> 1:5:6.480
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Yeah, I'm back, but I still don't have a chat link and now I can't even share my screen, so thanks getting worse.
1:5:15.300 --> 1:5:18.90
Miller, Laurence
If you can't see the chat, you're gonna need to be added to the team.
1:5:18.100 --> 1:5:18.570
Miller, Laurence
Probably.
1:5:19.0 --> 1:5:22.80
Miller, Laurence
Let's show it that hopefully if it less can sort out.
1:5:26.510 --> 1:5:28.590
N U, Chandu (External)
Uh, I already sent in a request to add him.
1:5:26.30 --> 1:5:29.530
Flagg, Todd
Is it somehow you were added as an attendee?
1:5:29.540 --> 1:5:31.30
Flagg, Todd
You need to be added as a present.
1:5:31.630 --> 1:5:32.320
Flagg, Todd
Is that true?
1:5:32.330 --> 1:5:33.610
Flagg, Todd
You have to add as a presenter.
1:5:35.710 --> 1:5:36.10
Flagg, Todd
What the?
1:5:34.850 --> 1:5:46.60
Miller, Laurence
No, just I I mean I think you need to be added into the team, but you they needed owner to approve them because they're not probably a member of the team where this channel is being being where the where the channel is being used.
1:5:58.980 --> 1:6:1.830
N U, Chandu (External)
They already sent the request to add him into this channel.
1:6:1.960 --> 1:6:2.610
N U, Chandu (External)
I don't think so.
1:6:2.620 --> 1:6:4.870
N U, Chandu (External)
It's still approved as that's what reason he's not getting it.
1:6:4.880 --> 1:6:5.890
N U, Chandu (External)
Option to see a chat.
1:6:12.740 --> 1:6:14.480
Flagg, Todd
OK, you should be there now, Sergey.
1:6:17.600 --> 1:6:19.220
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
A, here I can share.
1:6:18.810 --> 1:6:19.600
N U, Chandu (External)
Paul agree.
1:6:19.610 --> 1:6:21.590
N U, Chandu (External)
I can start a separate chat.
1:6:18.640 --> 1:6:23.40
Flagg, Todd
Can you at the very least you should be able to, yeah.
1:6:23.910 --> 1:6:25.530
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Yeah, I can share my screen now.
1:6:26.310 --> 1:6:26.580
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Uh.
1:6:26.590 --> 1:6:27.600
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Thought, thought I.
1:6:27.670 --> 1:6:33.780
Khunphet, Phonlawat
And you you refer to the secular support, right, I think Tretya has joy in this call.
1:6:34.640 --> 1:6:34.900
Flagg, Todd
OK.
1:6:36.770 --> 1:6:37.210
Gumella, Chaitanya (External)
You're fine.
1:6:36.80 --> 1:6:38.620
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, you can see with the.
1:6:38.630 --> 1:6:38.750
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah.
1:6:38.200 --> 1:6:39.70
Gumella, Chaitanya (External)
You have one more, yes.
1:6:39.800 --> 1:6:43.270
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Umm, he's from L2 team from.
1:6:46.820 --> 1:6:47.230
Flagg, Todd
OK.
1:6:47.660 --> 1:6:48.190
Flagg, Todd
Well, that's good.
1:6:48.200 --> 1:6:51.720
Flagg, Todd
I mean, ultimately I think that's we need to follow the correct.
1:6:53.120 --> 1:6:58.930
Flagg, Todd
Escalation process, we were just randomly all three on the same call, but so that's good.
1:6:59.570 --> 1:7:7.90
Flagg, Todd
Ultimately, I think you can see the error message now though, right in Sergei, are you able to copy and paste that ID that error ID?
1:7:8.710 --> 1:7:9.340
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah.
1:7:9.230 --> 1:7:9.410
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Uh.
1:7:9.390 --> 1:7:12.20
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I mean, maybe you can you move to the right hand side.
1:7:13.870 --> 1:7:14.180
Flagg, Todd
You just.
1:7:12.350 --> 1:7:15.490
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So I need to get to see the message error message.
1:7:17.120 --> 1:7:19.800
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, copy paste in the chat should be fine, yeah.
1:7:17.510 --> 1:7:21.850
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
I that I still don't have a chat.
1:7:23.360 --> 1:7:25.450
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Maybe can you move to the right hand side in the?
1:7:25.520 --> 1:7:27.340
Khunphet, Phonlawat
In the there is a so called bar, right?
1:7:29.650 --> 1:7:36.290
Khunphet, Phonlawat
That he has to go by and if you can move to the right hand side, we can see the remaining message in in that line.
1:7:39.820 --> 1:7:40.60
Klajko, Robert (External)
Yeah.
1:7:40.960 --> 1:7:41.550
Klajko, Robert (External)
Yeah.
1:7:41.560 --> 1:7:42.290
Klajko, Robert (External)
I'm sorry again.
1:7:41.900 --> 1:7:42.580
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Are you sure?
1:7:37.880 --> 1:7:43.600
Flagg, Todd
Yeah, just show your screen Sergey, and we'll just read the text and hopefully we can find it, yeah.
1:7:43.720 --> 1:7:45.240
Klajko, Robert (External)
Go back to the log file please.
1:7:46.430 --> 1:7:46.710
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
OK.
1:7:50.290 --> 1:7:52.460
Klajko, Robert (External)
And right hand side.
1:7:50.110 --> 1:7:52.680
Flagg, Todd
And if you can try to open.
1:7:53.260 --> 1:7:54.100
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Right hand side piece.
1:7:59.270 --> 1:7:59.630
Flagg, Todd
That does.
1:7:58.310 --> 1:7:59.930
Khunphet, Phonlawat
OK, has no file.
1:7:59.940 --> 1:8:0.190
Khunphet, Phonlawat
OK.
1:8:1.400 --> 1:8:6.210
Khunphet, Phonlawat
OK, you cannot update to Reddy, because there is no file in the file set.
1:8:6.770 --> 1:8:15.520
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, I think and this one doesn't mean is someone trying to they make the faucet available, right.
1:8:15.790 --> 1:8:18.730
Khunphet, Phonlawat
In this case, and there is no fight in the file set.
1:8:19.210 --> 1:8:27.310
Khunphet, Phonlawat
But who who, who intend to app, who intend to create the file in file set in this case?
1:8:27.320 --> 1:8:32.20
Khunphet, Phonlawat
But L16M is it coming from the DFD?
1:8:36.970 --> 1:8:38.940
Flagg, Todd
Yeah, I think this is on the ingestion side, right?
1:8:36.870 --> 1:8:39.330
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
It's coming from services.
1:8:39.50 --> 1:8:39.640
Flagg, Todd
So.
1:8:39.690 --> 1:8:47.140
Flagg, Todd
So basically file is files are placed on DFD and then CFS picks picks those up.
1:8:48.700 --> 1:8:51.210
Khunphet, Phonlawat
OK, let let me check from my side.
1:8:52.640 --> 1:8:54.650
Khunphet, Phonlawat
We need to see whether we have any issue or not.
1:8:59.280 --> 1:9:2.160
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So it allow 121.
1:9:3.60 --> 1:9:5.230
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Is it the UTC right. OK.
1:9:10.580 --> 1:9:14.110
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
I also showing the D that file was uploaded.
1:9:15.810 --> 1:9:16.980
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
All successfully.
1:9:26.40 --> 1:9:26.470
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Exist.
1:9:28.530 --> 1:9:29.680
Khunphet, Phonlawat
And and and what it.
1:9:29.840 --> 1:9:30.790
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Your machine ID.
1:9:37.950 --> 1:9:38.550
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
In my second.
1:9:39.550 --> 1:9:39.810
Khunphet, Phonlawat
OK.
1:9:45.840 --> 1:9:46.940
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
This is my mission ID.
1:9:51.920 --> 1:9:52.760
Khunphet, Phonlawat
OK, wait a moment.
1:9:53.900 --> 1:9:57.380
Khunphet, Phonlawat
160429 OK, thank you.
1:10:20.30 --> 1:10:24.320
Khunphet, Phonlawat
And can you also chat, skin again and and go to the log file?
1:10:26.170 --> 1:10:30.490
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I need to see the the file name or the file name.
1:10:34.100 --> 1:10:34.690
Khunphet, Phonlawat
OK, Pete.
1:10:34.700 --> 1:10:37.590
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Pete, keep this Peck showing in the screen, OK?
1:10:54.850 --> 1:10:56.10
Flagg, Todd
I just copy and pasted it.
1:10:57.760 --> 1:10:58.160
Khunphet, Phonlawat
OK.
1:10:58.200 --> 1:10:58.670
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Thank Carlos.
1:11:46.160 --> 1:11:56.760
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I can't see that that it's a fight, that it probably from the FDA around 111159 today 11:11 AM UTC.
1:11:58.60 --> 1:11:58.720
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Yeah, that's correct.
1:11:59.290 --> 1:12:0.910
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, 1111, right.
1:12:0.920 --> 1:12:7.430
Khunphet, Phonlawat
And you retype around 11:31 should be fine, but let me shape a moment.
1:14:6.450 --> 1:14:14.540
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I can see that the file has been OK let me just check again so the fire had been probably to save it while 1112.
1:14:14.830 --> 1:14:15.340
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah.
1:14:15.410 --> 1:14:23.970
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So it's like it's coming and take around two second to save it, but I'm I'm checking from the safest there's we see this one.
1:14:29.740 --> 1:14:32.870
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Yeah, like I said, something wrong with and the connection.
1:14:32.940 --> 1:14:44.560
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
The session couldn't establish correctly because those 500 errors I don't know for what reason and after that we got this error from CFL that files not exist.
1:14:46.510 --> 1:14:47.900
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
I believe this is the case because.
1:14:47.160 --> 1:14:49.450
Flagg, Todd
And what are the timestamps here is the.
1:14:49.520 --> 1:14:51.10
Flagg, Todd
Is there just a miss timing here?
1:14:54.670 --> 1:14:54.880
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Ah.
1:14:54.170 --> 1:14:55.840
Khunphet, Phonlawat
He different around 10 minute, right?
1:14:55.890 --> 1:15:0.380
Khunphet, Phonlawat
It different row 10 or 9 minutes from my side.
1:15:0.470 --> 1:15:12.970
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So and what I'm saying, like a the fire have been published around 11121112 I and so you are pulling the fire around 11:21 right?
1:15:13.560 --> 1:15:13.760
Flagg, Todd
Yeah.
1:15:15.230 --> 1:15:19.680
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So this is the is the same cancelled right and the same clock.
1:15:22.970 --> 1:15:23.890
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Is the time is correct?
1:15:24.0 --> 1:15:24.120
Flagg, Todd
Yeah.
1:15:25.30 --> 1:15:25.230
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Umm.
1:15:25.420 --> 1:15:25.910
Flagg, Todd
Yeah, me.
1:15:24.850 --> 1:15:27.140
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
We are trying to read in at 11:21.
1:15:29.360 --> 1:15:29.640
Khunphet, Phonlawat
OK.
1:15:27.460 --> 1:15:29.920
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
That is, we have a window.
1:15:37.380 --> 1:15:38.700
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, I'm checking for myself.
1:15:44.890 --> 1:15:46.910
Flagg, Todd
And we can rerun this job right now, right?
1:15:49.640 --> 1:15:54.540
Flagg, Todd
I mean, obviously we wouldn't automatically publish it, but we can rerun the job to confirm that it works.
1:16:0.70 --> 1:16:0.250
Flagg, Todd
Yeah.
1:15:55.940 --> 1:16:2.470
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Here we can, I believe, on the for a beta will already restarted it just to test it just works or not.
1:16:8.470 --> 1:16:9.810
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
And bedtimes running.
1:16:29.630 --> 1:16:38.120
Gummanur, Mahesh
Just for curiosity, so are we doing any changes in the production environment or just in takes you guys have performing here?
1:16:42.860 --> 1:16:43.410
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
I was there.
1:16:43.420 --> 1:16:44.300
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
I was no changes.
1:16:43.860 --> 1:16:47.860
Flagg, Todd
Uh, we better not be making changes in production environment at this time.
1:16:49.990 --> 1:16:53.60
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I think we are investigating and and let me just share my screen.
1:16:53.150 --> 1:16:53.620
Khunphet, Phonlawat
OK.
1:16:54.50 --> 1:16:57.120
Khunphet, Phonlawat
And and let me know if you see my screen.
1:17:0.220 --> 1:17:0.340
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Yes.
1:17:1.170 --> 1:17:3.310
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Easy to find that you mentioning right?
1:17:4.200 --> 1:17:5.20
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Is it a file name?
1:17:7.390 --> 1:17:7.720
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Yep.
1:17:7.730 --> 1:17:8.190
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
So I'm just.
1:17:8.340 --> 1:17:8.830
Khunphet, Phonlawat
OK.
1:17:8.950 --> 1:17:12.890
Khunphet, Phonlawat
And you can see right the lated modify it 11-12.
1:17:13.120 --> 1:17:14.370
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I tried to zoom in.
1:17:14.880 --> 1:17:17.310
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Sorry, I think I'm and this one.
1:17:17.380 --> 1:17:18.970
Khunphet, Phonlawat
You can say 11 too.
1:17:18.980 --> 1:17:20.870
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Well, is it Linta?
1:17:20.880 --> 1:17:22.540
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Well, so the file is our vote.
1:17:22.550 --> 1:17:30.240
Khunphet, Phonlawat
That and if I check for the file set ID, so I go back to the file says and and wait a moment.
1:17:30.350 --> 1:17:32.820
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So I'm gonna click OK this one.
1:17:32.930 --> 1:17:38.650
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So I try to check from the file set and this one is ready.
1:17:38.920 --> 1:17:39.80
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah.
1:17:40.660 --> 1:17:51.890
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So this one is ready and the modify it 11 too well, so everything looked good from the D side and go to the seabed so they can add the comment, inform save it can puppet the fileset.
1:17:52.100 --> 1:17:56.230
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I mean, sorry puppet the file and make fileset available 1112.
1:18:0.230 --> 1:18:10.750
Khunphet, Phonlawat
But I'm I still wonder on the UM the you are error message, but let me just deep dive into that error ID.
1:18:11.590 --> 1:18:18.670
Khunphet, Phonlawat
It does show you showing you that everything looking fine for the fire that you mentioning, but I need to check.
1:18:18.720 --> 1:18:19.560
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Uh, something more.
1:18:20.510 --> 1:18:23.60
Korenschi, Eduard
Yeah, but please be located a bit.
1:18:23.70 --> 1:18:26.440
Korenschi, Eduard
The status code is 502 bad gateway.
1:18:26.450 --> 1:18:29.80
Korenschi, Eduard
That's not a message that you get because the fire was not there.
1:18:31.610 --> 1:18:33.310
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, right. Umm.
1:18:31.940 --> 1:18:34.800
Outenah, Madjid
I think I think.
1:18:35.160 --> 1:18:35.390
Miller, Laurence
To get.
1:18:29.90 --> 1:18:36.980
Korenschi, Eduard
There was an ego transferring it or whatever validation that that's all or significant error message which is related to the infrastructure and.
1:18:38.10 --> 1:18:43.640
Outenah, Madjid
Uh, OK, so I think you need to see where I believe you are using RDP to get it or not.
1:18:43.650 --> 1:18:52.140
Outenah, Madjid
I think it's a really need to verify why you get why you are get from which library you are using to to do the request.
1:18:52.150 --> 1:18:54.770
Outenah, Madjid
To get this to to download those files.
1:18:56.430 --> 1:18:57.760
Outenah, Madjid
The bad gateway I.
1:18:58.10 --> 1:19:0.840
Outenah, Madjid
Is it CFS issuing bad gateway?
1:19:5.360 --> 1:19:6.20
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I I am.
1:19:0.850 --> 1:19:7.950
Outenah, Madjid
Or I guess if his team can confirm whether they they can issue such request or or.
1:19:7.70 --> 1:19:8.570
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, I I rented message.
1:19:8.580 --> 1:19:9.100
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Wait a moment.
1:19:9.110 --> 1:19:9.340
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I'm.
1:19:9.350 --> 1:19:9.620
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I'm.
1:19:16.450 --> 1:19:16.780
Outenah, Madjid
OK.
1:19:9.690 --> 1:19:17.450
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I'm I'm working with the Akshai, from the Advocate team, so we are checking on the 5:02 Alloli, yeah.
1:19:16.790 --> 1:19:25.930
Outenah, Madjid
So that's it's it's maybe if the if it is the RDP gateway, it's maybe a a series set the session or or all logging that was not correct.
1:19:26.0 --> 1:19:28.310
Outenah, Madjid
Action and may.
1:19:27.410 --> 1:19:28.740
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, but we need to check and confirm.
1:19:29.560 --> 1:19:30.40
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah.
1:19:30.50 --> 1:19:39.470
Outenah, Madjid
And maybe then when you, if you so so if if you do query I'm I guess then the error may not be correctly translated if.
1:19:41.480 --> 1:19:44.990
Outenah, Madjid
To see to file not available if the query files but it.
1:19:45.720 --> 1:19:49.960
Outenah, Madjid
But I need to look to the to the software stack doing the coder.
1:19:48.670 --> 1:19:50.660
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I think the so.
1:19:50.670 --> 1:19:52.560
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So Sharad, uh UD, right?
1:19:52.570 --> 1:19:55.30
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, we are tracing from here to UD.
1:19:56.400 --> 1:20:2.750
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
Umm, I think at where we cannot see any error from this UAUA D that got 502.
1:20:4.440 --> 1:20:9.520
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
O, everything is look good for these new UHD in in in Gateway.
1:20:15.40 --> 1:20:19.490
Khunphet, Phonlawat
OK, let me check from from server side.
1:23:48.890 --> 1:23:49.100
Vishwanathan, Shankar
A-Team.
1:23:49.110 --> 1:23:53.740
Vishwanathan, Shankar
The Shankar from Escalation team I happened to see there are no customer impact updated in the incident ticket.
1:23:55.660 --> 1:24:3.380
Vishwanathan, Shankar
Is there anything required from Friend Lane or like from the customer side, anything to be verified validated on nothing at this point in time?
1:24:5.660 --> 1:24:6.860
McWilliams, Thomas
No, there's nothing at this time.
1:24:7.490 --> 1:24:7.880
Vishwanathan, Shankar
OK.
1:24:7.950 --> 1:24:8.290
Vishwanathan, Shankar
Thank you.
1:25:1.60 --> 1:25:11.430
Khunphet, Phonlawat
OK, after checking there is no 502 from savers and I also check from the load balancer in front of the cbit as well.
1:25:11.540 --> 1:25:15.190
Khunphet, Phonlawat
That is no 500 tooling that time and confirm.
1:25:15.260 --> 1:25:18.10
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Also confirm that there is no issue from a.
1:25:20.220 --> 1:25:38.700
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I think we can see that that it's a required coming around 11 from RP, Way, but there is no 502 O, still wondering that it is possible to deep dive into the library that you are using for understand which imply that you are connecting and where that either come from.
1:25:46.120 --> 1:25:47.720
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I mean, for five years, who bad gateway?
1:25:59.660 --> 1:26:0.0
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So.
1:25:59.470 --> 1:26:0.850
Flagg, Todd
So I think I did.
1:26:0.860 --> 1:26:2.250
Flagg, Todd
I see this other chat you have.
1:26:3.10 --> 1:26:8.890
Flagg, Todd
I'm sorry I had to go offline for one second but umm that error message is not coming from that library.
1:26:12.550 --> 1:26:16.40
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Yeah, it's coming from some library and they don't know what what exactly is.
1:26:16.50 --> 1:26:16.760
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
It is library.
1:26:16.770 --> 1:26:19.80
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
It's a part or to D or self.
1:26:19.410 --> 1:26:21.690
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
I see that prod beta is also crashing.
1:26:21.850 --> 1:26:23.770
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Also, something wrong with their T library.
1:26:22.980 --> 1:26:25.910
Outenah, Madjid
It's Siri.
1:26:26.870 --> 1:26:27.560
Outenah, Madjid
I'm not sure.
1:26:27.570 --> 1:26:30.820
Outenah, Madjid
I downloaded the one of the Code of Honor your applications.
1:26:30.830 --> 1:26:40.520
Outenah, Madjid
I'm not sure, but it looks to me you are using the infinitive data libraries CFS module to download the file that are (External).
1:26:42.960 --> 1:26:43.160
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
OK.
1:26:40.530 --> 1:26:47.140
Outenah, Madjid
If I may can share, but sure this is the code, but it looks to me you are using the the Lib.
1:26:48.700 --> 1:26:50.870
Outenah, Madjid
This is the code of this term Sonia.
1:26:56.650 --> 1:26:56.850
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Yeah.
1:26:51.120 --> 1:27:0.530
Outenah, Madjid
So it looks to me you are getting importing via the LCD this refinitiv data platform.
1:27:11.520 --> 1:27:11.700
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Yes.
1:27:2.810 --> 1:27:16.490
Outenah, Madjid
And I guess and that's the publication you use the the, the, the, the that is the self-help Pi or publisher, but for the download you are it's a generic.
1:27:16.500 --> 1:27:19.160
Outenah, Madjid
So it's a subscriber, it's available from the LCD.
1:27:19.170 --> 1:27:21.710
Outenah, Madjid
You are using definitive data.
1:27:21.840 --> 1:27:25.140
Outenah, Madjid
I guess this is and show you this is the code.
1:27:26.350 --> 1:27:26.870
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Yeah, correct.
1:27:25.150 --> 1:27:30.100
Outenah, Madjid
Well, well, so yeah.
1:27:30.110 --> 1:27:43.10
Outenah, Madjid
So I guess it's maybe something to do with the with the with the credential or why we got this budget we at some stage I don't know, maybe need to look, but it's not this to get further.
1:27:47.340 --> 1:27:49.430
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Yeah, I tried to investigate and what?
1:27:49.440 --> 1:27:49.730
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
What?
1:27:49.820 --> 1:27:51.630
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
What I'm showing, let me share this.
1:27:51.640 --> 1:28:6.870
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Can I get that is the latest lock from the prod beta and as you can see again it's crashing in a thread P, it's a part of air D library refinitiv data.
1:28:8.120 --> 1:28:9.820
Outenah, Madjid
Access token OK.
1:28:12.260 --> 1:28:13.360
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Ah, this one right.
1:28:6.960 --> 1:28:13.390
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
See the library again, crashed, crashed and we we just stuck.
1:28:13.410 --> 1:28:14.630
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Uh, wait, wait a moment.
1:28:15.120 --> 1:28:35.10
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Can use go up so this one is like you OK you exit token right and then you are so that is some bug in the library I think I I have you that one before and when it returned uh HTML so it showed that there's an error it should be 50 to that you mentioned earlier yeah.
1:28:39.300 --> 1:28:41.420
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Should we check with the STF token?
1:28:41.860 --> 1:28:43.130
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I mean SS team on this.
1:28:46.540 --> 1:28:47.130
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
I don't know.
1:28:47.240 --> 1:28:50.880
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Probably we we had this issue before, this is not.
1:28:48.550 --> 1:28:52.520
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I mean we we we need to reach out to the S, OK.
1:28:52.940 --> 1:28:53.110
Flagg, Todd
Yeah.
1:28:52.530 --> 1:28:53.320
Khunphet, Phonlawat
If you go ahead, sorry.
1:28:54.130 --> 1:28:55.570
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Yeah, we had this issue before.
1:28:57.250 --> 1:29:2.480
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
As I understands the the idea was to update the library to avoid the soft issues, but.
1:29:2.550 --> 1:29:3.110
Khunphet, Phonlawat
How?
1:29:3.150 --> 1:29:4.740
Khunphet, Phonlawat
How many times do you see this error?
1:29:4.830 --> 1:29:5.430
Khunphet, Phonlawat
How many time?
1:29:6.190 --> 1:29:9.200
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Uh, maybe once in a couple months.
1:29:10.730 --> 1:29:12.300
Khunphet, Phonlawat
But uh, this is happened.
1:29:10.920 --> 1:29:13.90
Flagg, Todd
So it's weird is the fact that isn't this?
1:29:13.100 --> 1:29:18.200
Flagg, Todd
This is one of three files I think that we're grabbing.
1:29:21.30 --> 1:29:22.170
McWilliams, Thomas
Yeah, that's correct.
1:29:22.100 --> 1:29:31.590
Flagg, Todd
Umm, so at the what's weird is that we would be grabbing 3 files effectively at the same time, so we would odd just logically for me is that's so two of them passed.
1:29:32.120 --> 1:29:33.890
Flagg, Todd
One of them somehow got blocked.
1:29:33.900 --> 1:29:35.790
Flagg, Todd
By your I mean listen.
1:29:36.180 --> 1:29:39.70
Flagg, Todd
One of them got blocked by AAA, perhaps on a bad gateway call.
1:29:41.670 --> 1:29:41.880
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Maybe.
1:29:42.810 --> 1:29:43.600
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, might be possible.
1:29:43.150 --> 1:29:44.10
Flagg, Todd
I mean, we can bring.
1:29:42.640 --> 1:29:52.80
Korenschi, Eduard
Yeah, but they're not big Tahoe the same time today, as far as I know, actually they are picked up right before the level called computation happens.
1:29:52.90 --> 1:29:59.270
Korenschi, Eduard
So you get some source files, you compute the level of L1 and then you download the following ones.
1:30:0.170 --> 1:30:1.120
Korenschi, Eduard
Can you confirm Sai?
1:30:3.70 --> 1:30:4.390
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Yes, yes, correct.
1:30:4.790 --> 1:30:7.380
Korenschi, Eduard
So because of this, actually there is a time between these calls.
1:30:7.390 --> 1:30:14.980
Korenschi, Eduard
Sometimes tokens can expire or they need the refreshment, and sometimes that refreshment ohh fails.
1:30:15.670 --> 1:30:17.340
Khunphet, Phonlawat
And can I mean?
1:30:15.300 --> 1:30:19.860
Korenschi, Eduard
So maybe we should also change something and pick up all the files, download everything from the get go and.
1:30:19.690 --> 1:30:23.20
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, I think I think we can, we can make it more easier.
1:30:23.150 --> 1:30:28.910
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So we need to bring the STS RTA into the call so you can see right?
1:30:28.920 --> 1:30:30.970
Khunphet, Phonlawat
This is happening 1121, right?
1:30:31.160 --> 1:30:39.960
Khunphet, Phonlawat
And I think 502 might be related to the ECS and TA, so we need to to get them into the call to get clarification.
1:30:40.840 --> 1:30:42.620
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So we need to fix one by one.
1:30:43.650 --> 1:30:44.590
Khunphet, Phonlawat
You know what I mean, right?
1:30:45.510 --> 1:30:45.850
Flagg, Todd
Yeah.
1:30:45.860 --> 1:30:46.920
Flagg, Todd
So who's sorry?
1:30:46.930 --> 1:30:49.760
Flagg, Todd
Who's here from L1 or L2 can make the call out to AAA.
1:30:51.410 --> 1:30:53.980
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Let me let me send you in the chat, OK.
1:30:54.740 --> 1:30:54.910
Flagg, Todd
OK.
1:30:56.980 --> 1:31:1.410
Kurandwad, Sushant (External)
I think we we have got a person from advancing in the call will be they can call it to AAA.
1:31:1.860 --> 1:31:2.510
Kurandwad, Sushant (External)
Yes, please.
1:31:0.200 --> 1:31:2.550
N U, Chandu (External)
Yeah, I mean.
1:31:2.630 --> 1:31:2.910
Kurandwad, Sushant (External)
Yes.
1:31:3.590 --> 1:31:4.220
Kurandwad, Sushant (External)
Yes, thanks Andrew.
1:31:4.690 --> 1:31:5.0
N U, Chandu (External)
OK.
1:31:16.240 --> 1:31:20.710
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
So just to clarify, we have two separate issue 111.
1:31:21.230 --> 1:31:22.660
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
The first one it's about.
1:31:24.530 --> 1:31:25.180
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Delays.
1:31:25.190 --> 1:31:28.240
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
It's because we use an iteration on cell.
1:31:28.890 --> 1:31:31.700
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
We need to switch to another solution.
1:31:31.710 --> 1:31:36.480
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
How to check those while Technet and another one that this happens today?
1:31:36.490 --> 1:31:42.40
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Is this related to the D library that is crashed in some random time?
1:31:44.560 --> 1:31:56.570
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
And that is why when this session library session has crashed then we we lose the access to CFS and others services and we can't download or upload anything.
1:32:7.330 --> 1:32:12.510
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I I have sent the contact quite in the chat, so the first one is the chip away at the second one is the STS.
1:32:21.410 --> 1:32:21.820
Flagg, Todd
Thank you.
1:32:21.830 --> 1:32:24.70
Flagg, Todd
But with Sergey just said is highly concerning.
1:32:25.960 --> 1:32:28.280
Flagg, Todd
We've got some kind of failure on the already library side.
1:32:31.930 --> 1:32:38.240
Miller, Laurence
You didn't think we had these few weeks ago to solve dancing about bouncing about these between a couple of calls?
1:32:38.690 --> 1:32:40.420
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Yeah, maybe maybe three years ago.
1:32:37.140 --> 1:32:41.530
Flagg, Todd
Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1:32:45.300 --> 1:32:48.760
Miller, Laurence
And that was that was the cause.
1:32:42.680 --> 1:32:49.350
Flagg, Todd
I mean, listen AAA, they the troublesome area at the moment, but what I'm.
1:32:48.770 --> 1:32:50.70
Miller, Laurence
That was that was a it's a.
1:32:51.520 --> 1:32:54.990
Flagg, Todd
I'm I'm hoping that like at this time, Lawrence, I'm hoping that's a AAA issue.
1:32:55.800 --> 1:32:59.580
Flagg, Todd
If there's an issue on the Rd library that's more concerning to me.
1:33:1.30 --> 1:33:3.190
Miller, Laurence
Cause cause good.
1:33:3.200 --> 1:33:6.150
Miller, Laurence
Sorry again for dipping and out, but I got cut off another incident.
1:33:6.160 --> 1:33:7.230
Miller, Laurence
I'm dipping out of as well.
1:33:7.240 --> 1:33:16.770
Miller, Laurence
Is there I mean because when I was when I was seeing the screens minute ago, it was all to do with 502 errors, but that's that's connectivity that bad gateway type stuff, isn't it?
1:33:17.400 --> 1:33:17.630
Flagg, Todd
Umm.
1:33:19.830 --> 1:33:20.320
Miller, Laurence
So what?
1:33:20.330 --> 1:33:25.760
Miller, Laurence
What was it actually calling out to which, which meant we got bad gateway message back?
1:33:32.640 --> 1:33:34.240
Flagg, Todd
So the app is calling out to CFS.
1:33:35.490 --> 1:33:36.990
Flagg, Todd
UM to.
1:33:36.700 --> 1:33:42.30
Miller, Laurence
So is it safe that we turned the bad gateway or so it was trying to get to?
1:33:45.850 --> 1:33:50.380
Flagg, Todd
I think it is not CFS that's actually calling the bad gateway.
1:33:50.890 --> 1:33:53.320
Flagg, Todd
I think that's what's the CFS team just we're showing.
1:33:54.500 --> 1:33:54.730
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah.
1:33:54.320 --> 1:33:54.760
Miller, Laurence
Right. OK.
1:33:54.740 --> 1:33:55.110
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah.
1:34:9.470 --> 1:34:10.620
Miller, Laurence
Took Alloli, yeah.
1:33:55.160 --> 1:34:11.240
Khunphet, Phonlawat
And and and just want to say that umm when the token is expired it time to reflect the token from the STS and it will go to AAA and that time the the error might return from the deeper or STS and you'll get yeah.
1:34:11.280 --> 1:34:24.750
Khunphet, Phonlawat
But you are trying to call savings, but I think in term of the add rivalry, if we can make it more meaningful, so it will speed up for in the investigation, right that that what I I I mean.
1:34:27.170 --> 1:34:27.410
Flagg, Todd
Umm.
1:34:27.990 --> 1:34:29.590
N U, Chandu (External)
Moidu, can you engage AAA team?
1:34:32.190 --> 1:34:32.740
Dakoori, Madhu (External)
Yeah, sure.
1:34:32.750 --> 1:34:34.130
Dakoori, Madhu (External)
Chen, I'll give me a couple of minutes.
1:34:33.490 --> 1:34:35.0
N U, Chandu (External)
Thank you. Yeah.
1:35:55.800 --> 1:35:58.10
Miller, Laurence
Do we know the time frame for those 502 errors?
1:36:1.670 --> 1:36:3.810
Miller, Laurence
We got like a when they started and when they finished.
1:36:4.870 --> 1:36:10.20
Flagg, Todd
But we know when they hit our uh system exactly so.
1:36:8.100 --> 1:36:10.560
Miller, Laurence
Yeah, roughly, yeah.
1:36:12.700 --> 1:36:18.380
Miller, Laurence
So I I I'm but don't be sort of putting two and two together and coming up with five.
1:36:18.390 --> 1:36:20.490
Miller, Laurence
But there's an issue in Footsie.
1:36:21.380 --> 1:36:21.950
Miller, Laurence
They've lost.
1:36:21.960 --> 1:36:24.680
Miller, Laurence
They lost their feed handlers and I know they.
1:36:26.740 --> 1:36:34.890
Miller, Laurence
But don't know why though, but I'm just wanting to seems to be a sort of a similar time frame when they went offline and I wondered if they've at a hiccup.
1:36:34.900 --> 1:36:37.870
Miller, Laurence
We've not been able to get something off of supply as well.
1:36:37.880 --> 1:36:38.350
Miller, Laurence
I don't know.
1:36:38.620 --> 1:36:40.610
Miller, Laurence
Like I say, I've not been involved in the incident.
1:36:38.830 --> 1:36:43.280
Flagg, Todd
Don't think well, when you say Footsie, I don't think Footsie has a dependency on AAA as far as I know, Lawrence.
1:36:43.760 --> 1:36:44.310
Miller, Laurence
Yeah, we do.
1:36:44.320 --> 1:36:45.820
Miller, Laurence
We got, we got our RTO.
1:36:46.680 --> 1:36:48.870
Flagg, Todd
Ohh it's somewhere you interesting.
1:36:48.990 --> 1:36:50.680
Miller, Laurence
RTO yeah, it's you.
1:36:50.690 --> 1:36:52.740
Miller, Laurence
We used to have any D, But he's now uses RTO.
1:36:57.800 --> 1:37:0.610
Flagg, Todd
I don't think I'll be moving away from my eeds anytime soon then N,.
1:37:2.410 --> 1:37:2.980
Miller, Laurence
Yeah.
1:37:3.50 --> 1:37:3.640
Miller, Laurence
Tell me about it.
1:37:5.230 --> 1:37:8.750
Miller, Laurence
I'm told we never had any issue at all for years on the Ed's but.
1:37:11.590 --> 1:37:11.870
Flagg, Todd
Uh.
1:37:11.0 --> 1:37:12.660
Miller, Laurence
But multiple in the AAA.
1:37:13.840 --> 1:37:16.560
Flagg, Todd
I've been here for 16 years now.
1:37:18.230 --> 1:37:21.790
Flagg, Todd
Ten of which, her with the DS, and I remember.
1:37:20.90 --> 1:37:22.50
Miller, Laurence
Like, don't say it, don't say it.
1:37:22.670 --> 1:37:23.940
Flagg, Todd
And I I never had.
1:37:23.950 --> 1:37:25.770
Flagg, Todd
I've never had an Ed fail on me.
1:37:25.910 --> 1:37:30.80
Flagg, Todd
I've had them switch over but not had them crash or had this kind of issue.
1:37:30.170 --> 1:37:31.240
Flagg, Todd
But hey, what do I know?
1:37:34.40 --> 1:37:40.10
Miller, Laurence
But we're we're in the process of trying to move ours from version one as it's known, which is a forge gateway.
1:37:40.20 --> 1:37:44.280
Miller, Laurence
What is so to to version 2 which is pinned full drop?
1:37:42.110 --> 1:37:44.450
Flagg, Todd
Or drunk? Yep.
1:37:44.290 --> 1:37:50.90
Miller, Laurence
Thank you to version 2 which is using PINK with.
1:37:50.500 --> 1:37:58.970
Miller, Laurence
Looking at getting that in pretty quickly to see if that reduces their issues, or at least and I was asked to recover from them better.
1:38:14.200 --> 1:38:19.240
Miller, Laurence
So if we got a suspicion we it could be that we were trying to reach out to a AAA component during this period.
1:38:20.920 --> 1:38:22.110
Miller, Laurence
Boston is a sign.
1:38:22.120 --> 1:38:22.920
Miller, Laurence
Is there a suspicion?
1:38:27.610 --> 1:38:28.980
Flagg, Todd
And that's a theory.
1:38:28.990 --> 1:38:35.570
Flagg, Todd
At this second, I think it was 1221 is when we saw the and that's UTC I believe, right was when we saw the air.
1:38:37.480 --> 1:38:38.700
Miller, Laurence
1121 did you say?
1:38:39.830 --> 1:38:40.580
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Either one.
1:38:42.430 --> 1:38:43.200
Khunphet, Phonlawat
1111.
1:38:39.850 --> 1:38:43.420
Flagg, Todd
So it's 1121 or 1221, sorry I missed, I forgot what the screen.
1:38:42.850 --> 1:38:45.180
Miller, Laurence
So it's only it's only 1227 now.
1:38:45.900 --> 1:38:46.760
Flagg, Todd
Uh, well, listen.
1:38:48.710 --> 1:38:50.350
Flagg, Todd
Alright, time zones.
1:38:50.360 --> 1:38:51.130
Flagg, Todd
Those aren't my specialty.
1:38:51.290 --> 1:38:51.560
Miller, Laurence
Yeah.
1:38:51.570 --> 1:38:51.740
Miller, Laurence
Yeah.
1:38:51.750 --> 1:38:52.600
Miller, Laurence
No, that no that.
1:38:52.650 --> 1:38:53.190
Miller, Laurence
OK, get it mate.
1:38:57.880 --> 1:38:58.80
Flagg, Todd
Sure.
1:38:54.210 --> 1:39:4.330
Miller, Laurence
So it's just that I'm just trying to sort of line it up with the issues they've been having Footsie cause theirs is all around sort of 1145 ish 11301145 ish.
1:39:4.340 --> 1:39:10.700
Miller, Laurence
And if we're saying, as was 1121 through till whatever time we finished it is a similar time frame.
1:39:10.710 --> 1:39:15.960
Miller, Laurence
You know, I would say I don't wanna put two and two together and come up with five, but coincidence.
1:39:15.970 --> 1:39:17.50
Miller, Laurence
Coincidence is sometimes.
1:39:19.460 --> 1:39:20.390
Flagg, Todd
I think it's a.
1:39:20.440 --> 1:39:21.800
Flagg, Todd
It's a fair theory.
1:39:23.640 --> 1:39:25.220
Flagg, Todd
Or hypothesis I should say.
1:39:39.300 --> 1:39:46.990
Miller, Laurence
If we've got, can somebody get us the time frame of when we had those 502 errors please, cause I'll just, I'll Chuck it over to Steve and see if it line.
1:39:47.0 --> 1:39:53.970
Miller, Laurence
If it does link up or line up in any way with the issues that they have been seeing on Footsie, is a time for him.
1:39:52.810 --> 1:39:55.140
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I think there are two way that that there are two way.
1:39:55.150 --> 1:40:3.380
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So I checking from the the application log right that using the ID library or on waiting for STF.
1:40:3.390 --> 1:40:7.30
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Joy, our call and and and I think they.
1:40:6.560 --> 1:40:7.260
Miller, Laurence
What did we see?
1:40:8.70 --> 1:40:10.290
Miller, Laurence
What did we see in our life that we can see at the moment?
1:40:10.300 --> 1:40:16.430
Miller, Laurence
Cause what I saw on the screen a little while ago, there was clear 502502 and they started at one time and finished at another.
1:40:17.950 --> 1:40:19.440
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, I think we can check on the app.
1:40:19.450 --> 1:40:20.260
Khunphet, Phonlawat
We can lock, right?
1:40:20.330 --> 1:40:22.410
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, we can see the start time and in time.
1:40:23.130 --> 1:40:25.180
Miller, Laurence
Please, just as a matter of interest.
1:40:25.190 --> 1:40:28.950
Miller, Laurence
Like I say, I don't wanna sit as racing, but it just seems a bit coincidental, didn't it?
1:40:31.130 --> 1:40:31.420
Dakoori, Madhu (External)
Yeah.
1:40:31.430 --> 1:40:33.480
Dakoori, Madhu (External)
Hi, team Wasim, joining from triple end.
1:40:35.970 --> 1:40:36.210
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
OK.
1:40:40.30 --> 1:40:40.260
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Right.
1:40:40.20 --> 1:40:41.540
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
So what is the weather today?
1:40:47.570 --> 1:40:49.580
Flagg, Todd
I'm sorry I missed you exactly.
1:40:49.590 --> 1:40:50.340
Flagg, Todd
Is here from AAA.
1:40:52.330 --> 1:40:52.560
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
Yeah.
1:40:52.570 --> 1:40:53.580
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
What's the function of it?
1:40:54.560 --> 1:40:55.90
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
But it can help.
1:40:55.400 --> 1:40:55.800
Flagg, Todd
Of us.
1:40:55.810 --> 1:41:0.70
Flagg, Todd
And then I'm probably gonna need to get someone to share their screen, right?
1:41:2.830 --> 1:41:4.450
Khunphet, Phonlawat
OK, I think so.
1:41:4.460 --> 1:41:5.30
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Here, right.
1:41:5.40 --> 1:41:5.860
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So he can chair.
1:41:3.660 --> 1:41:6.60
Flagg, Todd
The what we're doing.
1:41:7.370 --> 1:41:8.480
Flagg, Todd
I yeah.
1:41:8.510 --> 1:41:8.650
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Yeah.
1:41:8.490 --> 1:41:11.480
Flagg, Todd
So I mean, we've got a we have a theory that's.
1:41:13.650 --> 1:41:18.760
Flagg, Todd
Umm, we are making a request into CFS at.
1:41:20.620 --> 1:41:24.680
Flagg, Todd
These times here I think 1120 something umm we see.
1:41:31.790 --> 1:41:32.910
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Visted of zeros.
1:41:27.800 --> 1:41:38.50
Flagg, Todd
Uh, we're starting to see bad gateway errors, but apparently from our side, or at least from the CFS side, that could be actually a AAA call.
1:41:43.880 --> 1:41:45.800
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
And not familiar with that.
1:41:43.630 --> 1:41:54.480
Flagg, Todd
So we needed someone from AAA to kind of look at the back end requests at this time to see if that is if we're seeing an error in AAA or forge rock or whatever it is or STS.
1:41:56.690 --> 1:41:57.220
Miller, Laurence
When did I?
1:41:57.280 --> 1:41:57.860
Miller, Laurence
When did I stop?
1:42:0.330 --> 1:42:4.530
Miller, Laurence
So is it or do we only have it for that sort of minute or so that shown on the screen at the moment?
1:42:6.560 --> 1:42:8.770
Flagg, Todd
Sergei, I think you're the one who's showing your screen.
1:42:8.780 --> 1:42:15.170
Flagg, Todd
It looks like it's just at the probably I thought it started at 21 and kept going to 25.
1:42:23.90 --> 1:42:24.540
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
You have two errors.
1:42:24.810 --> 1:42:28.10
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
One is starting 1121 here is.
1:42:30.210 --> 1:42:32.920
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
This response from API V2.
1:42:32.930 --> 1:42:44.450
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
I don't know what is this library and another one from our broad stage this one, but I believe this is a crash from the library I thought before.
1:42:45.10 --> 1:42:45.230
Flagg, Todd
Hmm.
1:42:46.820 --> 1:42:47.680
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
So it's us.
1:42:46.710 --> 1:42:48.60
Miller, Laurence
It says that it's caused the crash.
1:42:48.70 --> 1:42:48.530
Miller, Laurence
There is it.
1:42:49.250 --> 1:42:49.620
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Yeah.
1:42:49.630 --> 1:43:0.820
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
So something about like we're trying to update excess token and scratched and it scratched in a background thread and application keep running.
1:43:0.890 --> 1:43:1.970
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
So I have to stop it.
1:43:4.510 --> 1:43:11.700
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
So those two errors I don't know, do you how can you help us?
1:43:12.270 --> 1:43:15.960
Miller, Laurence
When there's when does it go through to about 121125, roughly years.
1:43:15.970 --> 1:43:16.980
Miller, Laurence
When they stopped, did you say?
1:43:21.120 --> 1:43:21.280
Miller, Laurence
Yeah.
1:43:18.690 --> 1:43:27.20
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
The first on the 11:21 and another one it's the same 1121 years, scared with the same same time.
1:43:26.980 --> 1:43:30.590
Miller, Laurence
And then we and then we, then we don't get anymore after that is that the last we see of it.
1:43:31.350 --> 1:43:32.880
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Yeah, that's the last one.
1:43:32.890 --> 1:43:37.710
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
After that application has stopped, so I don't know if this works now or no.
1:43:38.990 --> 1:43:41.180
Miller, Laurence
So as called an application crash there you.
1:43:44.80 --> 1:43:46.900
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
He has a application has crashed and I have to stop it.
1:43:48.470 --> 1:43:49.820
Miller, Laurence
Here we have to manually restart it.
1:43:49.830 --> 1:43:50.990
Miller, Laurence
Or did it automatically restart?
1:43:50.850 --> 1:44:7.280
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
It's it's usually it's automatically restarted, but if this crash happen in background thread or application keep running because it can't stop the ground red and this the ground thread just freezed and the application says started.
1:44:7.290 --> 1:44:8.780
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
That is why you have to stop it manually.
1:44:11.180 --> 1:44:13.890
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
This the ground threat was not generated on our side.
1:44:13.900 --> 1:44:18.750
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
It generated inside of a deal library and we can't handle it.
1:44:26.230 --> 1:44:33.340
Miller, Laurence
So so our our component crashed about 1121 due to those bad gateway issues, yeah.
1:44:34.330 --> 1:44:34.570
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
That's.
1:44:35.840 --> 1:44:36.200
Miller, Laurence
Thank you.
1:44:42.640 --> 1:44:45.300
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
They can also show I.
1:44:45.310 --> 1:44:47.970
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Should add key if it will help, I know.
1:44:48.960 --> 1:44:50.430
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I I will put in the chat.
1:44:50.510 --> 1:44:50.950
Khunphet, Phonlawat
OK.
1:44:51.320 --> 1:44:51.780
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Uh, OK.
1:44:56.930 --> 1:44:58.20
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
You see the chat.
1:44:58.30 --> 1:44:58.180
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
What?
1:44:51.40 --> 1:44:58.330
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So maybe it's the TV rating can hear check and let me know if you see in the chat DE 10429.
1:44:59.310 --> 1:45:1.690
Miller, Laurence
Incomplete pulling from last month.
1:44:58.190 --> 1:45:3.320
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
What you need to check from if able to log in right or not like that.
1:45:3.70 --> 1:45:4.140
Khunphet, Phonlawat
We need to figure it out.
1:45:4.510 --> 1:45:6.940
Miller, Laurence
Well, what's the cute?
1:45:4.150 --> 1:45:9.900
Khunphet, Phonlawat
We need to figure it out for when like access token right and retype the 5:02 bad gateway.
1:45:10.190 --> 1:45:15.890
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So we need to find the root cause why we got 502 bit only user.
1:45:15.850 --> 1:45:21.390
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
But if that is the end point of view, using against access again to a.
1:45:23.370 --> 1:45:32.380
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So you can do go into the the neck, the neck tab that it showed the access token, the Ajay token instructed, so it should be the token in pipe.
1:45:36.310 --> 1:45:37.320
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
I didn't get you.
1:45:37.510 --> 1:45:38.180
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
What talking?
1:45:38.50 --> 1:45:38.500
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Umm.
1:45:49.430 --> 1:45:49.800
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Ohh.
1:45:39.30 --> 1:45:50.970
Khunphet, Phonlawat
And can you go to the stack tip that it showed the stack type like a exit token and he'll Jason decode error or something like that and notify this this another one.
1:45:50.980 --> 1:45:54.150
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Another one I think we need to check one by one, OK.
1:45:56.720 --> 1:45:56.940
Khunphet, Phonlawat
And.
1:45:56.360 --> 1:45:59.650
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
OK, we have this final response.
1:46:0.260 --> 1:46:3.450
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
The bad gateway we have response.
1:46:4.590 --> 1:46:6.980
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Ah here.
1:46:8.150 --> 1:46:12.220
Khunphet, Phonlawat
And another red button that is show from add library that it is stacked.
1:46:12.650 --> 1:46:15.800
Khunphet, Phonlawat
It's called exit token update or something like that.
1:46:16.170 --> 1:46:17.20
Khunphet, Phonlawat
You you remember.
1:46:18.910 --> 1:46:19.110
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah.
1:46:16.540 --> 1:46:19.410
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Ah, yeah, yeah, it was.
1:46:19.420 --> 1:46:20.110
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Here, here.
1:46:20.550 --> 1:46:35.40
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So it wasn't, I think this one gonna call the token STR Token API and we got so should be like a 502 and it cannot decode at it return with the HTML format from Akhil token.
1:46:35.920 --> 1:46:36.330
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So.
1:46:36.340 --> 1:46:38.480
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So the first one we need to figure out.
1:46:38.960 --> 1:46:42.300
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Why the service return 502 bit on the user?
1:46:44.360 --> 1:46:50.390
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
Yeah, I'm asking for all the employee that you have exactly and point of it just because you access.
1:46:47.170 --> 1:46:50.420
Khunphet, Phonlawat
OK, let let let let me let me provide you, OK.
1:46:51.240 --> 1:46:54.710
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
Yeah, another application via EDP.
1:46:56.280 --> 1:46:56.810
Khunphet, Phonlawat
ADP.
1:46:54.720 --> 1:46:57.400
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
We are all essentially to AAA.
1:46:56.820 --> 1:46:58.450
Khunphet, Phonlawat
ADP Gateway RDP gateway.
1:47:2.240 --> 1:47:3.930
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, IDP in in our team.
1:46:59.430 --> 1:47:4.340
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
So maybe you have to check on NADP first, because if he.
1:47:8.170 --> 1:47:8.370
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
Umm.
1:47:4.220 --> 1:47:12.40
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Sorry it in TRT right now from Akshai, he he found the ERP gateway and he said there is no error from that side.
1:47:11.630 --> 1:47:13.160
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
It should stayed a lot.
1:47:14.210 --> 1:47:15.240
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, yeah, he check it.
1:47:13.170 --> 1:47:15.700
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
Listen, I mean.
1:47:15.440 --> 1:47:16.290
Khunphet, Phonlawat
It's like can you confirm?
1:47:16.980 --> 1:47:23.490
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
Yeah, we we cannot see because from our side, we cannot check by the UAD, right.
1:47:24.40 --> 1:47:33.490
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
What we can check is we using the IP address from this UHD but we cannot see anything that you know call to the.
1:47:35.120 --> 1:47:36.30
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
STS talking.
1:47:37.920 --> 1:47:38.170
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
Aye.
1:47:45.610 --> 1:47:50.180
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
Kind of that provide us the exactly employer that of the request was.
1:47:52.410 --> 1:47:52.610
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah.
1:47:51.20 --> 1:47:54.60
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
So we know it stop at which.
1:47:52.620 --> 1:47:54.710
Khunphet, Phonlawat
And provide uh, yeah, I'm providing.
1:48:14.800 --> 1:48:15.510
Khunphet, Phonlawat
He said in the chat.
1:48:24.930 --> 1:48:32.240
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Ohh I don't know I I bit loose what is what is, what is the goal of this conversation right now?
1:48:32.250 --> 1:48:42.360
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Because as I remember this is known issue about the 30 library crash and they said us that we should update the library to the latest version.
1:48:42.590 --> 1:48:45.210
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
So I don't know what exactly you want to reach right now.
1:48:49.140 --> 1:48:49.970
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
You mean me?
1:48:50.160 --> 1:48:55.40
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
No need to check this anymore because it's no issue for the clash of I believe.
1:48:54.590 --> 1:48:55.190
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Yeah, we have.
1:48:55.200 --> 1:49:2.950
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
We should, but it's crashing every couple months, so we know that it really library has this bug.
1:49:3.220 --> 1:49:3.960
Outenah, Madjid
Siri.
1:49:4.0 --> 1:49:5.190
Outenah, Madjid
Siri, if I may.
1:49:5.720 --> 1:49:10.590
Outenah, Madjid
When you say crushing last time it didn't crash, it just simply say it failed to connect.
1:49:12.0 --> 1:49:15.50
Outenah, Madjid
So I'm not sure what you mean by crush and you need at least two.
1:49:15.60 --> 1:49:16.520
Outenah, Madjid
Verify it is the same issue.
1:49:18.310 --> 1:49:19.580
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
OK, we can drive.
1:49:20.740 --> 1:49:22.340
Outenah, Madjid
Because I'm yeah.
1:49:20.650 --> 1:49:22.440
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Anybody know how to verify it?
1:49:23.430 --> 1:49:32.610
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah, but at least we we should try to get as much as possible formation because to my knowledge, the one we we've been told to upgrade.
1:49:32.730 --> 1:49:34.200
Outenah, Madjid
Audit was not crushing.
1:49:34.210 --> 1:49:39.100
Outenah, Madjid
It was simply saying that it was reporting a session, which he was OK but.
1:49:39.180 --> 1:49:39.260
Outenah, Madjid
But.
1:49:42.20 --> 1:49:43.640
Outenah, Madjid
But that didn't succeed to connect.
1:49:50.330 --> 1:49:51.890
Outenah, Madjid
Here you are saying it is crushing.
1:49:51.900 --> 1:49:54.470
Outenah, Madjid
Is it really a crush or just an error reported?
1:49:57.140 --> 1:49:59.130
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
It's too different.
1:49:55.590 --> 1:50:0.480
Outenah, Madjid
Because if you have an exception, uh throwing, yeah.
1:50:0.190 --> 1:50:1.470
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Do different tissue.
1:50:1.480 --> 1:50:6.370
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Like I said, the first one on production live, we couldn't read the file.
1:50:6.380 --> 1:50:8.980
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
We get this error message with 500 error.
1:50:10.710 --> 1:50:11.80
Outenah, Madjid
OK.
1:50:10.80 --> 1:50:11.530
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
And that's all we couldn't read.
1:50:11.540 --> 1:50:15.70
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
But the application keep running on prod stage.
1:50:15.580 --> 1:50:16.910
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
It just crashed.
1:50:16.980 --> 1:50:21.540
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
It's try to get excess token and just crashed and application keep running.
1:50:23.190 --> 1:50:23.440
Outenah, Madjid
Uh.
1:50:22.670 --> 1:50:25.890
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
So, and all the since you happen in the same time.
1:50:23.640 --> 1:50:27.320
Korenschi, Eduard
But the just the just a second. Just a second.
1:50:27.330 --> 1:50:28.180
Korenschi, Eduard
Saying Sahil.
1:50:28.330 --> 1:50:28.470
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Yeah.
1:50:28.190 --> 1:50:30.860
Korenschi, Eduard
But Are you sure that's here where you're saying that it crashed?
1:50:30.870 --> 1:50:35.350
Korenschi, Eduard
It actually did crash because go a little bit back to the previous screen.
1:50:36.760 --> 1:50:36.940
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Yeah.
1:50:38.470 --> 1:50:40.80
Korenschi, Eduard
But here you have a look a little bit.
1:50:40.90 --> 1:50:42.400
Korenschi, Eduard
You have tried to open up this session library.
1:50:47.620 --> 1:50:47.960
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Umm.
1:50:56.450 --> 1:50:57.450
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Yes, I know, but.
1:50:42.410 --> 1:50:59.20
Korenschi, Eduard
OK, you have that kind of multiple retire to open it and it says 1 exception in that thread and you are dumping this tech trace and then you go on with the ping pong which to me it looks like the initial attempt.
1:50:59.610 --> 1:51:0.10
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Because.
1:50:59.510 --> 1:51:3.340
Korenschi, Eduard
OK, it crashed that initial attempt, but then you still went on and do.
1:51:3.350 --> 1:51:3.930
Korenschi, Eduard
It worked.
1:51:3.940 --> 1:51:6.950
Korenschi, Eduard
So you got like a functioning session on a second attempt.
1:51:5.240 --> 1:51:7.730
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
I I won't stop. Stop.
1:51:7.740 --> 1:51:8.490
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Give me a second.
1:51:8.560 --> 1:51:11.110
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
This ping pong in is in a separate thread.
1:51:11.160 --> 1:51:14.280
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
It will be running till our main thread is running.
1:51:14.380 --> 1:51:21.30
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Ping pong is running because our application is still alive, but the main thread is frozen.
1:51:21.180 --> 1:51:27.840
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
It's waiting for the library library has crashed in the ground truth and we can't continue.
1:51:29.950 --> 1:51:32.340
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
And we have a deadlock.
1:52:33.880 --> 1:52:35.930
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
So what is our next step?
1:52:36.200 --> 1:52:37.770
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Can we get any more details?
1:52:55.150 --> 1:52:55.780
Kurandwad, Sushant (External)
I'm so sorry.
1:52:55.790 --> 1:53:7.930
Kurandwad, Sushant (External)
So if you if you say that this issue is related to a delivery, then do we have to include is supporting delivery senator can have a permanent fix for this?
1:53:10.0 --> 1:53:10.750
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Yeah, for sure.
1:53:10.760 --> 1:53:16.100
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
We can pick them, but like I said previously, they said they we need to update the the library.
1:53:17.410 --> 1:53:17.800
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
That's all.
1:53:19.70 --> 1:53:22.510
Kurandwad, Sushant (External)
I mean the update should be done on the R side, right?
1:53:24.400 --> 1:53:26.20
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
They should be done on self side.
1:53:27.20 --> 1:53:27.530
Kurandwad, Sushant (External)
Have said OK.
1:53:30.20 --> 1:53:31.960
Kurandwad, Sushant (External)
As in, we have model right from self.
1:53:33.220 --> 1:53:34.640
Kurandwad, Sushant (External)
Someone did any comments on this?
1:53:37.440 --> 1:53:38.450
Outenah, Madjid
Yeah.
1:53:38.740 --> 1:53:43.850
Outenah, Madjid
On that side, I shared the the communication with them with their fair team and.
1:53:46.940 --> 1:53:52.540
Outenah, Madjid
Well, confirming which version of her Dilip to use to and then we schedule the upgrade.
1:53:53.370 --> 1:53:56.400
Outenah, Madjid
So then we need to go through a qualification that's working progress.
1:53:57.680 --> 1:53:59.190
Outenah, Madjid
They don't have time for now.
1:53:59.700 --> 1:54:6.90
Outenah, Madjid
They need to confirm they are dealing version and then when when they confirm which are the live version, we should upgrade to.
1:54:6.100 --> 1:54:8.0
Outenah, Madjid
Then we will schedule the upgrade.
1:54:12.690 --> 1:54:22.690
Kurandwad, Sushant (External)
OK, so during that time, Sir, he, uh, do you think that this is there any work around until the self upgrades to will test version of Adal library?
1:54:25.350 --> 1:54:32.670
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
The only one who work around just to monitor application and restart it when it's crashed.
1:54:33.100 --> 1:54:34.410
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
That is what we're doing right now.
1:54:37.610 --> 1:54:38.930
Kurandwad, Sushant (External)
That's we are doing right now, I think.
1:54:40.20 --> 1:54:40.390
Kurandwad, Sushant (External)
Umm.
1:54:42.80 --> 1:54:44.800
Kurandwad, Sushant (External)
Then I then I don't see any other solution right apart from waiting.
1:54:45.630 --> 1:54:50.920
Kurandwad, Sushant (External)
Well, they'll self updates and of the newer delivery.
1:54:53.750 --> 1:54:53.990
Kurandwad, Sushant (External)
And.
1:54:50.590 --> 1:55:4.50
Flagg, Todd
But like Sergey, even if we the let's just say we were on a proactive TRT at runtime and they noticed that they were getting an error, they weren't able to get this to process.
1:55:4.520 --> 1:55:11.270
Flagg, Todd
Or are we not able to manually rerun the job to try to see if it's just transitory and AAA?
1:55:11.360 --> 1:55:12.440
Flagg, Todd
Because I thought that's the case.
1:55:13.210 --> 1:55:26.860
Flagg, Todd
But you're saying, like, the thing that was disturbing me is that you said that this failed in both prod, beta and prod at the same time, which would imply that it's not just like a transitory AAA connection thing that we I thought we saw previously.
1:55:30.950 --> 1:55:34.250
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
And yeah, usually we can.
1:55:34.440 --> 1:55:34.770
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
We can.
1:55:34.780 --> 1:55:44.760
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
We can stop it manually and they stop your job, but the content team for usually just click and suspend and then do it manually.
1:55:52.730 --> 1:55:52.990
Flagg, Todd
OK.
1:55:44.830 --> 1:55:53.340
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Update if if, if they notice any issue, maybe it is the faster way, that is why they doing it.
1:55:54.130 --> 1:55:56.120
Flagg, Todd
So I guess they there's two things though.
1:55:56.130 --> 1:56:1.620
Flagg, Todd
Is that one is that are we 100 a 100% positive that in this case right here it's it.
1:56:1.630 --> 1:56:5.30
Flagg, Todd
It goes back to the same kind of issue, the triple, the AAA issue.
1:56:11.20 --> 1:56:18.260
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yet at I don't see any any evidence forms, CSI and yeah, confirmation from the adipic gateway as well.
1:56:19.290 --> 1:56:26.240
Flagg, Todd
So here's a question is like, why is it not absolutely clear and I'm trying to figure out what's what's missing here?
1:56:26.250 --> 1:56:30.210
Flagg, Todd
Because why is it not absolutely clear that this is a AAA issue?
1:56:32.120 --> 1:56:39.810
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I think I think from from my opinion it coming from the ID library, it doesn't say uh where that error come from.
1:56:40.480 --> 1:56:40.630
Flagg, Todd
Yeah.
1:56:40.220 --> 1:56:45.210
Khunphet, Phonlawat
The exact URL that you are sending, so we just see that error, right?
1:56:45.220 --> 1:56:47.610
Khunphet, Phonlawat
But it doesn't not care at all, yeah.
1:56:51.420 --> 1:56:56.330
Khunphet, Phonlawat
And I also tried to check with the your user right and there is no error from our side.
1:56:56.870 --> 1:56:57.110
Flagg, Todd
Hmm.
1:56:56.680 --> 1:57:9.120
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I mean in 50 to get that we need more meaningful on the library that it is the main important it will speed up the investigation, it can reach out to the right team quickly.
1:57:12.290 --> 1:57:13.540
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Yeah, I agree there is.
1:57:13.610 --> 1:57:15.250
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
There is no issue with Dave.
1:57:15.260 --> 1:57:17.160
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
DCFS all fine.
1:57:17.450 --> 1:57:20.720
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
The problem right now is, is this 30 library.
1:57:22.650 --> 1:57:33.90
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
I don't know if if you ask her the library, I believe they will answer that we just proxy library and also 500 errors are coming from AAA.
1:57:37.860 --> 1:57:38.120
Flagg, Todd
Hmm.
1:57:34.930 --> 1:57:40.460
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
So I don't know how can how we can check those logs because we don't have a endpoints.
1:57:41.450 --> 1:57:42.210
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
What they used.
1:57:44.820 --> 1:57:46.820
Flagg, Todd
No, I mean, but that's that can't be correct though, right?
1:57:46.830 --> 1:57:51.670
Flagg, Todd
Cause the transaction ID is set up when the token request is made out to AAA, right?
1:57:53.190 --> 1:58:8.910
Flagg, Todd
We should be able to trace this back to the exact error message that came in cause like ultimately their packaging up our machine ID, the request, the transaction creating the token, establishing the connection with AAA and managing that token request.
1:58:9.420 --> 1:58:11.330
Flagg, Todd
If it fails, then we get this.
1:58:12.20 --> 1:58:13.0
Flagg, Todd
Kind of error message.
1:58:15.560 --> 1:58:15.830
Flagg, Todd
So.
1:58:14.960 --> 1:58:15.970
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, from from.
1:58:16.20 --> 1:58:32.860
Khunphet, Phonlawat
From my experience from period TRT, that related to these kids, so we have the STH join the call and they can heal to check the information from that side so they can see with user request and what an error from their side yeah.
1:58:35.60 --> 1:58:38.520
Khunphet, Phonlawat
If it possible to to act the St it join the call.
1:58:39.510 --> 1:58:40.750
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, that would be helpful.
1:58:43.200 --> 1:58:43.350
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
Yeah.
1:58:44.930 --> 1:58:45.190
Khunphet, Phonlawat
OK.
1:58:43.450 --> 1:58:47.310
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
Then let's try with our here.
1:58:51.150 --> 1:58:51.630
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
He said.
1:58:50.640 --> 1:58:52.470
Khunphet, Phonlawat
You mean I want from victim?
1:58:51.730 --> 1:58:57.670
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
My Moidu, you know you have someone that called me to join this call.
1:58:57.300 --> 1:58:58.560
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Ah, OK.
1:59:3.530 --> 1:59:3.810
Kurandwad, Sushant (External)
I think.
1:59:2.710 --> 1:59:4.100
Vishwanathan, Shankar
But in this not is.
1:59:4.510 --> 1:59:5.660
Vishwanathan, Shankar
Is it a major incident?
1:59:5.670 --> 1:59:9.450
Vishwanathan, Shankar
Like do we need to actually engage MIM or it's not required at this point in time?
1:59:13.640 --> 1:59:16.190
Flagg, Todd
So the problem we have is that this is an IBS critical app.
1:59:20.430 --> 1:59:21.870
Vishwanathan, Shankar
Then they should, yeah.
1:59:22.470 --> 1:59:24.10
Bal, Sudhanshu
No, I think this is not a.
1:59:20.360 --> 1:59:33.300
Flagg, Todd
So in so The thing is, is that we've hacked a a way to get this thing will not hacked, but we have a way of manually publishing this thing, but it's still.
1:59:33.970 --> 1:59:34.790
Flagg, Todd
Can someone get me the?
1:59:36.60 --> 1:59:38.260
Flagg, Todd
Can someone get me the incident from like a couple weeks ago?
1:59:40.550 --> 1:59:44.300
Flagg, Todd
I don't remember when the last time this is, but this it's it should be the same thing.
1:59:44.350 --> 1:59:48.500
Flagg, Todd
To all part of the same issue that we've we've continually be having with with AAA.
1:59:56.460 --> 1:59:58.140
Flagg, Todd
In theory, at this point in time.
1:59:56.930 --> 1:59:59.280
Vishwanathan, Shankar
And not understood.
1:59:59.320 --> 1:59:59.520
Vishwanathan, Shankar
So.
1:59:59.230 --> 2:0:0.250
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
I don't have anymore.
1:59:59.530 --> 2:0:3.580
Vishwanathan, Shankar
So, right, right now we are not actually thinking to measure it, right?
2:0:3.590 --> 2:0:4.0
Vishwanathan, Shankar
Is that?
2:0:4.10 --> 2:0:5.320
Vishwanathan, Shankar
Is that what's even though?
2:0:5.330 --> 2:0:6.120
Vishwanathan, Shankar
It's an ideas.
2:0:6.430 --> 2:0:8.780
Vishwanathan, Shankar
They still trying to focus on the recovery and not maturing it.
2:0:14.340 --> 2:0:20.840
Flagg, Todd
We don't have a client impact at this second outside of the clients being the internal content operations team.
2:0:22.850 --> 2:0:26.900
Flagg, Todd
The client the content operations team are able to publish the values.
2:0:29.980 --> 2:0:30.230
Vishwanathan, Shankar
OK.
2:0:28.810 --> 2:0:35.810
Flagg, Todd
Manually, but it is a is a very onerous process.
2:0:37.450 --> 2:0:41.250
Flagg, Todd
For them to do this like we should have the automated services in place.
2:0:43.730 --> 2:0:45.750
Flagg, Todd
Uh to be able to do this calculation right?
2:0:46.810 --> 2:0:51.970
Flagg, Todd
So we don't want them to have to manually calculate this on the fly going forward.
2:0:57.200 --> 2:0:57.780
Vishwanathan, Shankar
Understood.
2:0:57.790 --> 2:0:58.60
Vishwanathan, Shankar
Thank you.
2:1:18.750 --> 2:1:23.570
Flagg, Todd
So have we been able to add someone from that STS team?
2:1:24.920 --> 2:1:26.400
Flagg, Todd
I thought that was that vasin but.
2:1:26.0 --> 2:1:29.530
Khunphet, Phonlawat
And I think it was in put, uh, percent.
2:1:29.540 --> 2:1:30.950
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Uh, leave the message in the chat.
2:1:31.800 --> 2:1:33.370
Flagg, Todd
OK, send.
2:1:31.80 --> 2:1:35.750
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So I think why do I need to take a action, right? Yeah.
2:1:38.810 --> 2:1:39.220
Akkineni, Prasad (External)
Yeah.
2:1:39.230 --> 2:1:45.880
Akkineni, Prasad (External)
Yeah, but what I mean, I'm also watching steam, but what is the issue exactly from triple RSTS?
2:1:47.660 --> 2:1:48.760
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
It had to actually.
2:1:48.770 --> 2:2:3.100
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
They don't know that there's to be an issue or not, but they have a message like a a part of AAA token so that their thing that might be the issue with AAA STS that they calling to get the token.
2:2:4.950 --> 2:2:5.240
Flagg, Todd
Umm.
2:2:5.250 --> 2:2:6.360
Flagg, Todd
Sergei, can you do me a favor?
2:2:6.370 --> 2:2:7.950
Flagg, Todd
If you haven't done this, I don't see it here.
2:2:7.960 --> 2:2:14.510
Flagg, Todd
Can you copy and paste just the log messages in the chat in case we have to keep going through this and you have to drop off?
2:2:15.470 --> 2:2:15.630
Akkineni, Prasad (External)
Yeah.
2:2:14.640 --> 2:2:20.700
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Uh, I don't have access to the chat, but I can send you directly in teams.
2:2:19.980 --> 2:2:22.290
Flagg, Todd
Yeah, send it to me then, and I will.
2:2:22.340 --> 2:2:23.490
Flagg, Todd
I'll put it in the chat then.
2:2:24.300 --> 2:2:31.980
Flagg, Todd
Sorry, we keep asking you to share your screen, but really we just need to copy and paste the A the log messages, right?
2:2:40.480 --> 2:2:49.430
Flagg, Todd
So, Prasad, ultimately, we've gotta like, we need to get the UM, we'll get you the transaction ID that we have in our machine account.
2:2:50.330 --> 2:2:54.160
Flagg, Todd
Umm, but ultimately we were trying to make a call into CFS.
2:2:55.320 --> 2:2:59.930
Flagg, Todd
Yeah, this R, app we're getting a bad gateway error message.
2:3:1.30 --> 2:3:7.780
Flagg, Todd
Umm, but from what we've checked with CFS and other and the other services, the application.
2:3:9.600 --> 2:3:13.710
Flagg, Todd
The files were there or I should say the data was there within CFS.
2:3:15.340 --> 2:3:23.500
Flagg, Todd
Umm, it seems to come back to AAA where the error message where that error message is getting sourced from.
2:3:25.90 --> 2:3:31.550
Akkineni, Prasad (External)
Uh triple before trip play it reaches the data services like Gateway, right?
2:3:32.160 --> 2:3:32.420
Flagg, Todd
Correct.
2:3:31.760 --> 2:3:34.780
Akkineni, Prasad (External)
So did Gateway Team identified any issues?
2:3:38.880 --> 2:3:39.110
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
Not.
2:3:38.130 --> 2:3:39.440
Flagg, Todd
You mean like the RDP gateway?
2:3:39.450 --> 2:3:39.970
Flagg, Todd
Is that what you mean?
2:3:38.390 --> 2:3:40.110
Akkineni, Prasad (External)
It could play the last hop here.
2:3:43.980 --> 2:3:44.420
Akkineni, Prasad (External)
Sorry, go ahead.
2:3:44.160 --> 2:3:56.180
Flagg, Todd
I don't think we have anyone on the triple uh from AAA on this call at the 2nd, but I'm happy to kind of get a I'm happy to try to get someone from AAA on the call as well if we can reach out to him first.
2:3:55.180 --> 2:3:57.640
Akkineni, Prasad (External)
No, no, no.
2:3:57.650 --> 2:3:57.710
Akkineni, Prasad (External)
A.
2:3:57.720 --> 2:4:0.190
Akkineni, Prasad (External)
We are in the call, right? Yeah.
2:3:57.290 --> 2:4:0.870
Flagg, Todd
A AAA thought to to RDP or I'm I meant to say RP,.
2:4:1.980 --> 2:4:3.210
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
Umm I'm.
2:4:3.220 --> 2:4:8.810
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
I'm from the RDP gateway as well, actually from RDP Gateway log we cannot.
2:4:9.720 --> 2:4:13.490
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
We did not lock the UAD when tried to exit the token.
2:4:14.990 --> 2:4:24.890
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
So from our side is hardly you know to to file what happened when the user cannot get the token right?
2:4:33.120 --> 2:4:33.800
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
Let sure.
2:4:42.40 --> 2:4:45.30
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I think Solana from 80th joined the call, right?
2:4:47.700 --> 2:4:48.460
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Thing I.
2:4:50.460 --> 2:4:50.740
Khunphet, Phonlawat
OK.
2:4:47.860 --> 2:4:51.560
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
Is the PE team from a authentication part?
2:4:52.580 --> 2:4:52.790
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Mm-hmm.
2:4:53.580 --> 2:4:56.550
Khunphet, Phonlawat
But we are looking for second, there was a part, right?
2:4:58.740 --> 2:5:0.330
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
So we'll end our form developer team.
2:5:1.60 --> 2:5:1.270
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Mm-hmm.
2:5:3.120 --> 2:5:4.640
Akkineni, Prasad (External)
No, we we actually can do a couple.
2:5:3.380 --> 2:5:5.660
Flagg, Todd
So yeah.
2:5:5.890 --> 2:5:7.590
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Hello guys it's your from SS.
2:5:12.30 --> 2:5:12.520
Flagg, Todd
Hey, Yuri.
2:5:13.310 --> 2:5:13.600
Flagg, Todd
Yeah.
2:5:13.330 --> 2:5:13.780
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
Hey, you.
2:5:13.610 --> 2:5:17.650
Flagg, Todd
I mean, ultimately we've got, we're just trying to find the source of a problem here.
2:5:19.70 --> 2:5:22.720
Flagg, Todd
Uh, it seems that we are going.
2:5:23.490 --> 2:5:24.20
Flagg, Todd
Umm.
2:5:25.910 --> 2:5:29.130
Flagg, Todd
Ohh man sorry keep feel like I'm keep repeating myself here.
2:5:31.770 --> 2:5:32.930
Flagg, Todd
Uh, we need to.
2:5:32.940 --> 2:5:37.70
Flagg, Todd
We're basically making a call into an application called CFS.
2:5:39.120 --> 2:5:41.800
Flagg, Todd
Uh to grab some files or grab some data?
2:5:42.580 --> 2:5:47.340
Flagg, Todd
UM, the requests this morning gave us a bad gateway error message.
2:5:48.710 --> 2:5:55.980
Flagg, Todd
That error message we tried to trace back the the data that we were requesting was available at that time within CFS.
2:5:57.60 --> 2:6:2.940
Flagg, Todd
It seems that the IT seems that the error message was somehow getting uh.
2:6:4.60 --> 2:6:7.450
Flagg, Todd
Since then, through AAA Umm.
2:6:9.370 --> 2:6:11.740
Flagg, Todd
Sorry, is that a lot?
2:6:11.990 --> 2:6:12.600
Flagg, Todd
A lackey.
2:6:12.650 --> 2:6:13.140
Flagg, Todd
Is that right?
2:6:13.150 --> 2:6:13.780
Flagg, Todd
You're from.
2:6:13.910 --> 2:6:15.320
Flagg, Todd
You're from RDP as well.
2:6:15.710 --> 2:6:25.930
Flagg, Todd
You're basically saying that you don't believe that the error message is coming in from RDP at all, so we think that this error message is 502 gateway error is actually coming in from AAA or STS.
2:6:29.100 --> 2:6:29.470
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
OK.
2:6:29.400 --> 2:6:29.780
Flagg, Todd
So.
2:6:29.480 --> 2:6:33.60
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Do we have some messages from the RDP side?
2:6:33.790 --> 2:6:36.200
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Umm, so that points us to the error.
2:6:37.560 --> 2:6:38.190
Flagg, Todd
I can get you the.
2:6:40.30 --> 2:6:40.410
Flagg, Todd
We see.
2:6:37.800 --> 2:6:41.800
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Some specific one maybe request ID or something like that?
2:6:42.650 --> 2:6:44.80
Flagg, Todd
Yeah, I'm seeing.
2:6:43.280 --> 2:6:45.490
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Exam below Ferrer will be helpful.
2:6:46.400 --> 2:6:46.560
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Yeah.
2:6:47.760 --> 2:6:51.370
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
What we are looking for and where where the error?
2:6:50.60 --> 2:6:51.630
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
I can share my screen once again.
2:6:52.380 --> 2:6:52.610
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Yeah.
2:6:52.620 --> 2:6:53.70
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
OK. Please.
2:6:54.490 --> 2:7:2.470
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
So the first message that was coming like this also share 500 bad request.
2:7:2.520 --> 2:7:5.800
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
That's all, and I don't know what is API V2 version.
2:7:5.860 --> 2:7:7.810
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
I guess maybe it's a part of Reddy, library.
2:7:10.420 --> 2:7:11.210
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
This was the 1st.
2:7:10.290 --> 2:7:11.330
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
API with two.
2:7:10.970 --> 2:7:13.660
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
OK, let's let me check it.
2:7:16.10 --> 2:7:20.700
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Uh, do we have the region or something here?
2:7:20.710 --> 2:7:23.970
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
And by the way, does this problem still exist?
2:7:26.140 --> 2:7:27.650
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Now you don't know it's production.
2:7:27.660 --> 2:7:29.90
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
We can just restart it.
2:7:32.320 --> 2:7:33.950
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
It should be on Mars.
2:7:31.890 --> 2:7:34.390
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Of that we have some customer cases or something like that.
2:7:38.260 --> 2:7:42.170
Flagg, Todd
So in the case in this case this is an application that runs once a day.
2:7:42.460 --> 2:7:47.300
Flagg, Todd
Fortunately, it's a very critical application. Umm.
2:7:52.0 --> 2:7:53.250
Flagg, Todd
We'd have to try to rerun it.
2:7:53.260 --> 2:7:57.140
Flagg, Todd
We'd have to rerun it again to see if we continue to generate the error, right?
2:7:58.230 --> 2:7:58.800
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Yeah, right.
2:7:59.0 --> 2:7:59.220
Flagg, Todd
That.
2:8:4.390 --> 2:8:6.310
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
He yeah, it's.
2:7:58.810 --> 2:8:7.980
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
So basically I I want to know whether this is was fixed or not, because it's mainly could be some network blip or something like that.
2:8:8.210 --> 2:8:9.550
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
So if we have.
2:8:8.650 --> 2:8:9.650
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
It's happens.
2:8:11.20 --> 2:8:16.970
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
It's happened maybe once per several months, so I believe it's it's not reproducible anymore.
2:8:18.90 --> 2:8:18.310
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
OK.
2:8:18.220 --> 2:8:20.590
Flagg, Todd
Well, I think it happened just a couple weeks ago, didn't it?
2:8:17.980 --> 2:8:20.650
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
The problem is this crashed at some point of time.
2:8:21.100 --> 2:8:21.510
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Yeah.
2:8:20.600 --> 2:8:22.310
Flagg, Todd
Didn't it, Sergey? That's.
2:8:21.520 --> 2:8:24.990
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Yeah, it's yeah for and this this case here.
2:8:24.240 --> 2:8:25.120
Flagg, Todd
I don't want to keep going.
2:8:25.130 --> 2:8:31.320
Flagg, Todd
I can't keep going back to a couple months when it's happening, you know, so I I'm on way too many calls with AAA.
2:8:30.370 --> 2:8:32.490
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Couple months sounds more optimistic.
2:8:31.510 --> 2:8:36.720
Flagg, Todd
Uh, on a variety of different issues, so it's not always on RR, but it is happening.
2:8:37.470 --> 2:8:39.560
Flagg, Todd
I think the last time this happened was a couple weeks ago.
2:8:39.610 --> 2:8:42.260
Flagg, Todd
We're going down the same path as what we think it is.
2:8:42.270 --> 2:8:43.610
Flagg, Todd
It's another AAA issue.
2:8:44.840 --> 2:8:45.700
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
OK so.
2:8:47.760 --> 2:8:49.290
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Ohh yeah.
2:8:45.350 --> 2:8:53.340
Flagg, Todd
It may be transitory, but the problem is is the fact that like when this runs and it fails, it causes it has a a pretty.
2:8:55.190 --> 2:8:56.290
Flagg, Todd
Big impact on us.
2:8:57.490 --> 2:8:58.20
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
And another.
2:8:57.460 --> 2:9:5.150
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Why we are so confident that it's Tripoli issue, I don't see in the logs and the messages that pointing to AAA.
2:9:5.380 --> 2:9:6.760
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
It's maybe AAA.
2:9:5.720 --> 2:9:7.130
Khunphet, Phonlawat
And so we're not wait, wait a moment.
2:9:7.140 --> 2:9:7.670
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Wait a moment.
2:9:7.740 --> 2:9:10.290
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I can so he can go back again.
2:9:10.360 --> 2:9:12.190
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Can you go back to PS1?
2:9:13.240 --> 2:9:13.660
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
This one.
2:9:12.520 --> 2:9:16.910
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So I want in the line number 21281.
2:9:21.220 --> 2:9:21.570
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Umm.
2:9:17.300 --> 2:9:28.580
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So before we calling the back end with the RDP so we can exit the token from ATS and it seems returned the hit team L something like that.
2:9:28.880 --> 2:9:40.60
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, that I think it would be limited to 502 bad gateway with the hint Team error format and then the service this library it cannot decode the error.
2:9:40.390 --> 2:9:46.980
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I I think if you are able to check the user I think I will put in the chat again and we have this.
2:9:47.70 --> 2:9:47.250
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Yep.
2:9:47.40 --> 2:9:50.250
Khunphet, Phonlawat
The dissipative optimal stamp it around 11 to 21 today.
2:9:52.0 --> 2:9:54.140
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
1171.
2:9:51.190 --> 2:9:55.870
Khunphet, Phonlawat
If uh, is it possible for you 211121?
2:9:57.100 --> 2:10:0.360
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Uh, let me double check.
2:10:2.290 --> 2:10:4.290
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Ohh, just a moment.
2:10:3.50 --> 2:10:4.620
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
You can different usual idea.
2:10:5.710 --> 2:10:7.100
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
It's different your idea.
2:10:5.410 --> 2:10:9.770
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
OK guys, do we have region of this region of this request?
2:10:8.870 --> 2:10:10.370
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Ohh let let me.
2:10:10.380 --> 2:10:12.90
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Yeah, you're let me check in.
2:10:10.820 --> 2:10:12.620
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Pretend you edit one retained.
2:10:12.630 --> 2:10:13.450
Khunphet, Phonlawat
You edit one, yeah.
2:10:14.840 --> 2:10:16.300
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
It's OK.
2:10:14.120 --> 2:10:24.850
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
You're as is 1, so basically from from the SDS I can see that we have some network bleep in the same time 1121 in the US region.
2:10:24.860 --> 2:10:34.310
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
So we had a few containers that was dying basically and was recreated, but I'm not sure whether it's connected.
2:10:34.770 --> 2:10:35.280
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Uh.
2:10:35.690 --> 2:10:41.20
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
From this problem, but it's very strange that the time is pretty identical.
2:10:43.150 --> 2:10:44.170
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Can you repeat check first?
2:10:43.200 --> 2:10:45.680
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Uh, so you sorry.
2:10:45.50 --> 2:10:48.100
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Umm, I mean can you repeat check first?
2:10:50.50 --> 2:10:57.830
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Uh, I only can see that some health checks on our side was failing for only one minute and after that recovered.
2:10:58.980 --> 2:11:6.470
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
So this type of error could possibly goes to the 502 bad gateway on the client side.
2:11:7.880 --> 2:11:13.680
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
But the reason why I'm asking it because it's in the U region so.
2:11:15.730 --> 2:11:16.700
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
We need to know.
2:11:16.710 --> 2:11:19.650
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Uh, maybe some request ID because it's.
2:11:21.680 --> 2:11:25.340
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
It's pretty OK is that we have some cross region traffic or something like that.
2:11:27.410 --> 2:11:27.570
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
No.
2:11:28.250 --> 2:11:28.980
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So he can.
2:11:28.660 --> 2:11:30.570
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
To confirm that I need more details.
2:11:28.990 --> 2:11:30.740
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Can you confirm the region again?
2:11:31.70 --> 2:11:36.170
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Can you confirm the region with the STS and US1 or US1 that you are calling?
2:11:35.450 --> 2:11:36.280
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
No UU.
2:11:36.290 --> 2:11:36.760
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Best one.
2:11:36.770 --> 2:11:37.140
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Yeah.
2:11:37.150 --> 2:11:39.620
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
So we have one minute bleep.
2:11:39.810 --> 2:11:46.850
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
We wasn't regulating it, but seems like it's some on network side or AW stuff, so yeah.
2:11:47.810 --> 2:11:50.650
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Are you sure that there is no issue on the US is 1.
2:11:52.10 --> 2:11:54.680
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Uh, currently I can.
2:11:54.730 --> 2:11:56.580
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
I can run our test just to confirm.
2:11:55.460 --> 2:11:57.190
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Mayor show the mayor.
2:11:57.200 --> 2:12:0.520
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Mayor, should the screen please, so to show the current status?
2:12:3.350 --> 2:12:3.850
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Thank you.
2:12:2.260 --> 2:12:4.870
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
But you may give me a minute.
2:12:5.690 --> 2:12:6.350
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Umm.
2:12:6.390 --> 2:12:15.550
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
And by the way, I do not see any connections to on premise become today for this user.
2:12:15.560 --> 2:12:16.40
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
It's all.
2:12:18.560 --> 2:12:27.920
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
For the previous users that was here in the chat, I saw some connections and I saw that session was deleted, but for that one I see nothing just yesterday.
2:12:32.480 --> 2:12:38.550
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
So it suggests that most likely user was not able to reach authentication at all.
2:13:0.650 --> 2:13:4.270
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
So yeah, let me let me show you what I what I was talking about.
2:13:4.460 --> 2:13:8.860
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
So if you can see my screen, yeah, could you?
2:13:11.120 --> 2:13:39.850
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
This is STS in three regions USU and AP at what was talking about is this errors then you then you can see the spikes so it's in the EU region in the US one we have not any 500 OK one but it's it's another timing in that current time period the from their SDS perspective we are clean in this like.
2:13:41.380 --> 2:13:45.400
Khunphet, Phonlawat
But there is an error around 11:15 right that you are showing.
2:13:46.360 --> 2:13:47.250
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
1118.
2:13:48.470 --> 2:13:50.470
Khunphet, Phonlawat
151150 umm.
2:13:47.260 --> 2:13:53.910
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Yeah, and here's the response 818181318.
2:13:58.400 --> 2:13:58.910
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Uh.
2:13:55.120 --> 2:13:59.200
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I mean, in the US is one, there is no, you mean there is no error.
2:13:59.220 --> 2:14:0.310
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
In the US, yeah.
2:14:0.320 --> 2:14:3.270
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Yeah, you can see that pretty everything is alright.
2:14:3.280 --> 2:14:6.620
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
But in you we have some some sleep for one minute only.
2:14:8.410 --> 2:14:14.910
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
So the reason I'm asking just just to know whether I should investigate it in the US or in the UK.
2:14:21.410 --> 2:14:22.980
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
What is in the on Prem?
2:14:23.20 --> 2:14:26.810
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
I mean, Kathy did station forgive you?
2:14:26.270 --> 2:14:27.890
Flagg, Todd
My apologies, I'm trying to remember.
2:14:26.820 --> 2:14:29.190
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
Say creating the Plano.
2:14:29.210 --> 2:14:31.160
Flagg, Todd
Don't see is Magid still in here?
2:14:31.210 --> 2:14:31.780
Flagg, Todd
I think he is.
2:14:31.890 --> 2:14:35.790
Flagg, Todd
He's on hold like so isn't so the actual request that's being made?
2:14:37.980 --> 2:14:40.750
Flagg, Todd
It's getting deployed into US E 1, right?
2:14:40.760 --> 2:14:45.700
Flagg, Todd
Sergei, I think is where the self is is actually getting placed.
2:14:47.160 --> 2:14:48.610
Flagg, Todd
I don't believe it's an EW one.
2:14:49.690 --> 2:14:50.890
Flagg, Todd
I think it's in US E 1.
2:14:52.580 --> 2:14:54.570
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
I have no idea to be honest.
2:14:54.960 --> 2:14:55.190
Flagg, Todd
Umm.
2:14:54.610 --> 2:14:56.190
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Majid only can answer.
2:15:7.10 --> 2:15:8.440
Flagg, Todd
My memory is that it's an in.
2:15:8.490 --> 2:15:9.820
Flagg, Todd
It's only in US E 1.
2:15:11.830 --> 2:15:12.190
Flagg, Todd
Uh Yuri.
2:15:14.170 --> 2:15:14.500
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
OK.
2:15:13.840 --> 2:15:14.870
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
Umm in.
2:15:14.510 --> 2:15:25.260
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
But do we have some user or request ID or someone from the Arabic P, side that could just find us whether they had an error?
2:15:27.500 --> 2:15:30.140
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
No one user posted in the chat.
2:15:31.150 --> 2:15:31.480
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
OK.
2:15:32.500 --> 2:15:32.620
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Yeah.
2:15:31.490 --> 2:15:33.880
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Yeah, I'll check it, but nothing weird.
2:15:33.690 --> 2:15:35.390
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Uh. Mm-hmm.
2:15:34.70 --> 2:15:37.420
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
So it's pretty, it's pretty good consumption.
2:15:37.430 --> 2:15:41.560
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
All the STS always 200 only in US E one.
2:15:41.570 --> 2:15:45.570
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Yeah, you're right from this perspective, but nothing stranger there.
2:15:58.530 --> 2:16:6.170
Khunphet, Phonlawat
But but in in the lock it seemed to me that there is a request to send a letter to the token service around 11:21.
2:16:8.60 --> 2:16:12.530
Khunphet, Phonlawat
That, umm, but but the request does not go into the lock, right?
2:16:12.720 --> 2:16:13.330
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I have tried.
2:16:13.340 --> 2:16:20.580
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Didn't understand that if the Soviet returned 502, it will reject without printing anything in the log, right?
2:16:21.850 --> 2:16:27.490
Bey, Olga (External)
No, on this test side we are logging all successful and unsuccessful requests.
2:16:27.570 --> 2:16:33.210
Bey, Olga (External)
So if some request is absent, it might probably mean that this request didn't reach a stairs at all.
2:16:34.950 --> 2:16:37.320
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, and got the Hitapp out error format.
2:16:39.380 --> 2:16:42.950
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Because you're so with that doesn't return his team out error format, right?
2:16:43.120 --> 2:16:46.320
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I mean from your application log is your application itself.
2:16:49.410 --> 2:16:49.650
Bey, Olga (External)
No.
2:16:48.830 --> 2:16:52.800
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
A lead tracking of request and response as well.
2:16:52.810 --> 2:16:58.700
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
So if you were able to reach as S, we should have something in our logs.
2:17:0.430 --> 2:17:2.630
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, that, that it doesn't mean it doesn't hit.
2:17:0.250 --> 2:17:2.660
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Yeah, the, the the graphic that I was short.
2:17:0.210 --> 2:17:5.300
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
If there is nothing, it seems like, uh, you was not able to reach us to us.
2:17:7.50 --> 2:17:7.290
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Umm.
2:17:6.800 --> 2:17:7.620
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Yeah, I understand.
2:17:7.630 --> 2:17:24.990
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
What you're talking about so from the previous graphic that I was shared to you, so we have the load balancers metrics that show us, yeah, we won't won't see the request in the logs, but from the load balancer perspective and request heating the STS.
2:17:25.0 --> 2:17:36.250
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
So we will see the file to or at least 5X on the load balancers, but most likely that request you will not landing on the SS side.
2:17:41.700 --> 2:17:46.580
Flagg, Todd
So this is back to an Rea possible RDP gateway issue.
2:17:47.740 --> 2:17:49.140
Flagg, Todd
So what I'm hearing from your side area?
2:17:50.730 --> 2:17:52.830
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Uh, we could not be pretty sure.
2:17:52.840 --> 2:17:59.780
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
So without any details about specific requests, specific user timing, request ID or something like that.
2:18:1.400 --> 2:18:4.770
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
Let let let me share my form IDP gateway right.
2:18:5.730 --> 2:18:5.890
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Yep.
2:18:4.780 --> 2:18:9.780
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
So I'm trying to confirm that in the you did you just idea right?
2:18:11.730 --> 2:18:16.840
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
Call all the API to the lithium US is 1 right?
2:18:16.970 --> 2:18:25.140
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
As I mentioned that in IDP get where we did not log UID when request for the token right?
2:18:25.150 --> 2:18:37.560
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
So normally we use the IP address to trace the request from token request like so you can see that for this user it come from this IP address.
2:18:37.920 --> 2:18:44.890
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
So if I kewley the data from this IP address and.
2:18:47.230 --> 2:18:48.790
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
Bit or hot?
2:18:50.530 --> 2:18:51.20
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
I.
2:18:53.700 --> 2:18:54.190
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
We try.
2:19:8.230 --> 2:19:9.650
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
This, at least out from.
2:19:11.410 --> 2:19:19.100
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
This IP address, but it's a lot so I cannot identify which one that is from the UID.
2:19:19.170 --> 2:19:20.320
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
DUADI.
2:19:22.260 --> 2:19:22.530
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
OK.
2:19:20.690 --> 2:19:22.940
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
See, so let me.
2:19:22.540 --> 2:19:25.460
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
But can we see some errors only here?
2:19:26.380 --> 2:19:26.620
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
OK.
2:19:29.630 --> 2:19:32.380
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
Let me try, OK.
2:19:48.660 --> 2:19:55.40
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
Yeah, is the only one that is not even fall into the timeline that we mentioned, right?
2:19:55.50 --> 2:20:19.20
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
We mentioned that it's about 11:21 right for today, but the error that we got that is more than 200, the state that code like can see only on 917 and got 400, that's all that I can trace from IDP side by using the IP address not UID.
2:20:24.120 --> 2:20:36.740
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
So meaning that if this user ID is sent from this IP address is mean that I also cannot see the request at 11:21 from multiple gateway.
2:20:39.210 --> 2:20:41.360
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
OK, but where is the air itself?
2:20:41.370 --> 2:20:44.360
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
So we have some 400.
2:20:44.410 --> 2:20:47.710
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Yeah, by the way, could you share their request ID?
2:20:47.750 --> 2:20:52.550
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
I pretty sure that some kind of column should be here in the slots.
2:20:54.750 --> 2:20:57.70
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
I don't have request ID in the IDP.
2:20:59.750 --> 2:21:3.290
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
I don't have the request ID from IDP get weather.
2:21:15.750 --> 2:21:19.160
Khunphet, Phonlawat
And and the problem it in the application log that I I see earlier.
2:21:19.490 --> 2:21:24.850
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So when received 502 bad gateway, there is no anything related to liquid as well.
2:21:40.220 --> 2:21:42.490
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
Yes, yes, yes.
2:21:33.940 --> 2:21:42.600
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
I mean it, it is sharing right now is 400 isn't mean HTTP 400 error is a bad request that stock.
2:21:42.500 --> 2:21:43.530
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
But but it's not.
2:21:46.20 --> 2:21:46.330
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
Umm.
2:21:43.580 --> 2:21:48.750
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
It's not the same timeline that you sleep hot at 11:21, right?
2:21:48.800 --> 2:21:51.290
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
Because this one is like a 917.
2:21:51.580 --> 2:21:51.960
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
Yeah.
2:21:52.40 --> 2:21:52.650
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
That's what we got.
2:21:55.550 --> 2:21:56.600
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
Yeah, didn't mean it.
2:21:56.650 --> 2:22:0.20
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
Today there is no active session for this user.
2:22:0.30 --> 2:22:0.870
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
It did not.
2:22:1.720 --> 2:22:4.930
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
It never get token while today.
2:22:4.940 --> 2:22:11.300
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
So in the application itself should have no talking the same, so it failed.
2:22:11.550 --> 2:22:12.780
TRAKARNKEERATI, VASIN (External)
Is it expected right?
2:22:14.380 --> 2:22:17.190
Flagg, Todd
Hey guys sorry I'm really O,.
2:22:18.690 --> 2:22:22.70
Flagg, Todd
I'm not really understanding what's what's being discussed here.
2:22:23.440 --> 2:22:27.350
Flagg, Todd
So we basically have an app that's deployed into self.
2:22:27.900 --> 2:22:39.130
Flagg, Todd
So we basically have an authentication process where we're trying to connect to RDP, the RDP Gateway via basically through self into RDP.
2:22:39.520 --> 2:22:41.410
Flagg, Todd
It doesn't authentication request.
2:22:41.480 --> 2:22:44.120
Flagg, Todd
We grab our files, we end the session, right?
2:22:45.740 --> 2:22:50.50
Flagg, Todd
So we have I just posted the logs into the file.
2:22:50.440 --> 2:22:53.960
Flagg, Todd
I know what the machine ID is that we're using to connect everything.
2:22:55.20 --> 2:22:55.490
Flagg, Todd
Umm.
2:22:55.500 --> 2:23:1.990
Flagg, Todd
I see like transaction ID's here on the log messages, or at least some sort of item ID.
2:23:2.820 --> 2:23:4.970
Flagg, Todd
So why is it that we cannot?
2:23:5.10 --> 2:23:8.710
Flagg, Todd
We know that on some of these we are getting an error message back that says bad gateway.
2:23:8.860 --> 2:23:14.300
Flagg, Todd
So why is it that we can't figure out where the error where that error message originated from?
2:23:19.660 --> 2:23:24.350
Bey, Olga (External)
So usually to understand uh from whom you receive this error message.
2:23:24.490 --> 2:23:33.790
Bey, Olga (External)
Uh, it is worse to check response headers, but in that case, at least in your logs we could not see any response headers.
2:23:34.280 --> 2:23:45.160
Bey, Olga (External)
If this is possible to change logging on your site to like receive and collect this response headers, it would be much easier to identify.
2:23:53.860 --> 2:23:56.630
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I think should be the question to the the application team.
2:24:1.600 --> 2:24:5.860
Flagg, Todd
Well, we are the application team, or at least I'm part of the application team, but that's what you're asking.
2:24:7.70 --> 2:24:7.520
Bey, Olga (External)
Yeah.
2:24:8.620 --> 2:24:9.510
Korenschi, Eduard
So the the, the.
2:24:10.240 --> 2:24:10.900
Flagg, Todd
But but.
2:24:12.250 --> 2:24:13.310
Korenschi, Eduard
The challenge here is.
2:24:7.530 --> 2:24:16.900
Bey, Olga (External)
So the question is whether this is possible to change the code so and from your side grabs this response headers.
2:24:18.10 --> 2:24:29.240
Flagg, Todd
Yeah, I don't think that is going to be possible because ultimately we're utilizing something called Rd library to.
2:24:31.370 --> 2:24:36.160
Flagg, Todd
Facilitate the connection to our the RDP gateway through self.
2:24:39.420 --> 2:24:49.190
Flagg, Todd
So if there's a way to change that, I think the guy who is actually we kind of utilize in many of these cases is on hold at the moment, unless we have someone here from the Rd lab team.
2:24:50.710 --> 2:24:53.590
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
OK, at least can we just rerun that failed part?
2:24:54.370 --> 2:24:54.940
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Is it possible?
2:24:56.370 --> 2:24:57.530
Korenschi, Eduard
You know.
2:24:56.250 --> 2:24:57.950
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
It's not possible to reproduce.
2:25:2.140 --> 2:25:2.320
Korenschi, Eduard
The.
2:25:0.410 --> 2:25:3.270
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Uh, so you said that?
2:25:1.680 --> 2:25:5.210
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
And the delivery for love for us, just a black box.
2:25:5.220 --> 2:25:7.630
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
We just a customer.
2:25:7.640 --> 2:25:10.930
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
So those library, we don't see a code we can change it.
2:25:12.920 --> 2:25:13.670
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Yeah, I got it.
2:25:13.680 --> 2:25:13.840
Akkineni, Prasad (External)
What?
2:25:14.0 --> 2:25:18.490
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
So we have some just strange behavior from time to time, right?
2:25:21.870 --> 2:25:22.20
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Yes.
2:25:20.120 --> 2:25:27.350
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
And that something is failing but for but for now it's working pretty OK, right?
2:25:32.110 --> 2:25:32.800
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
She would be.
2:25:31.820 --> 2:25:36.50
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Do we have some customer input impact right now in this moment?
2:25:37.760 --> 2:25:43.420
Flagg, Todd
Umm so the the problem you have is that again this is this only runs once a day for this specific app.
2:25:45.500 --> 2:25:49.460
Flagg, Todd
I don't believe we have any other rates that are running for the rest of the day.
2:25:49.470 --> 2:25:53.830
Flagg, Todd
I think Barbara's on the line, either Barbara or Mag does on the line probably are actually even.
2:25:53.840 --> 2:25:54.320
Flagg, Todd
See Ben here.
2:25:55.630 --> 2:25:58.690
Flagg, Todd
I don't believe we have any other rates they're running today, is that correct?
2:26:1.340 --> 2:26:1.640
Swann, Barbara
Height.
2:26:1.270 --> 2:26:2.640
McGowan, Ben
Now all the rates are done.
2:26:3.420 --> 2:26:3.580
Flagg, Todd
Yeah.
2:26:5.910 --> 2:26:6.480
Swann, Barbara
Thanks, Ben.
2:26:5.590 --> 2:26:6.850
Flagg, Todd
But the problem is this.
2:26:6.490 --> 2:26:7.470
Swann, Barbara
Yeah, I had my headset off.
2:26:8.380 --> 2:26:8.710
Flagg, Todd
Yeah.
2:26:8.720 --> 2:26:12.200
Flagg, Todd
The problem we're gonna have is that in later on this night.
2:26:12.650 --> 2:26:13.170
Flagg, Todd
Umm.
2:26:13.190 --> 2:26:23.650
Flagg, Todd
In Japan time, we're gonna have a we're gonna have a a run that's gonna go through a similar process, and that's gonna be kind of off hours.
2:26:23.660 --> 2:26:24.130
Flagg, Todd
Kind of support.
2:26:25.260 --> 2:26:30.480
Flagg, Todd
So if we're going to have a problem, we want to make sure that we're heading this off now, obviously.
2:26:37.100 --> 2:26:39.430
Flagg, Todd
So it's seems it's transitory.
2:26:39.440 --> 2:26:39.600
Flagg, Todd
What?
2:26:39.610 --> 2:26:40.170
Flagg, Todd
I'm again.
2:26:40.180 --> 2:26:45.580
Flagg, Todd
I mean, where I'm where I'm like, concerned is the fact that like we have a problem.
2:26:47.370 --> 2:26:52.830
Flagg, Todd
And we're not able to trace something back to where the actual problem is.
2:26:53.360 --> 2:26:56.810
Flagg, Todd
It seems like from a AAA side you're saying I've never.
2:26:56.820 --> 2:27:0.970
Flagg, Todd
We never even got a request from the RDP side.
2:27:1.50 --> 2:27:15.590
Flagg, Todd
It seems unclear how to actually get to establish where where the transaction is done, and we don't have a way to actually manipulate or enable any kind of verbose logging on the road library.
2:27:17.210 --> 2:27:17.420
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Umm.
2:27:17.430 --> 2:27:21.420
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
So let let me just show you what we have from the SDS side.
2:27:21.640 --> 2:27:31.110
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
So for this user then 40 to 9, we can see the request from starting from 25.
2:27:33.90 --> 2:27:38.420
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
And we have a this request and each and every is 200.
2:27:38.430 --> 2:27:44.10
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
So from the AAA and SDS side I can see that there are a lot of requests.
2:27:44.20 --> 2:27:45.850
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Basically in the 11:21.
2:27:47.290 --> 2:27:50.790
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
So it's almost each second.
2:27:50.800 --> 2:27:55.430
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
So this is a bit weird because if you can see the pattern.
2:27:55.480 --> 2:28:1.450
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Ohh no, it's basically not weird because we can see the same behavior here.
2:28:1.540 --> 2:28:5.790
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
So every minute you just go and take the token so.
2:28:7.870 --> 2:28:11.920
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
That's the second at least lifetime has 10 minutes.
2:28:11.930 --> 2:28:16.580
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
So you should do it at least one per eight minute or something like that, but anyway.
2:28:18.270 --> 2:28:21.920
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
So yeah, you can see that all the statuses is 200.
2:28:21.930 --> 2:28:24.970
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
If I knew that nothing.
2:28:27.610 --> 2:28:27.770
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Yep.
2:28:25.100 --> 2:28:29.250
Khunphet, Phonlawat
How you you're wait a moment in term of the the token request, right?
2:28:29.680 --> 2:28:29.990
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Is.
2:28:30.170 --> 2:28:30.350
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Yeah.
2:28:30.540 --> 2:28:35.30
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So user are calling get token every one minute, right?
2:28:35.190 --> 2:28:35.370
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Yeah.
2:28:35.80 --> 2:28:36.350
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Or listen.
2:28:36.520 --> 2:28:37.50
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So is it?
2:28:37.100 --> 2:28:38.690
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Is it what?
2:28:38.700 --> 2:28:39.290
Khunphet, Phonlawat
What?
2:28:39.340 --> 2:28:42.980
Khunphet, Phonlawat
But they they should get every 10 minute right. The token.
2:28:42.900 --> 2:28:43.170
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Mm-hmm.
2:28:43.360 --> 2:28:43.710
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Good.
2:28:43.780 --> 2:28:46.480
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Yeah, should, but it's not happening.
2:28:45.50 --> 2:28:47.530
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, that, that this one is umm.
2:28:50.20 --> 2:28:51.440
Khunphet, Phonlawat
They're they're called token frequently.
2:28:50.150 --> 2:28:54.180
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
The the best pattern is just use refresh grant.
2:28:54.190 --> 2:29:6.580
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
So the basic flow is you go to the password grant, you get the access talking with a pair of refresh token and you will refresh that access token.
2:29:6.920 --> 2:29:9.740
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
For example, every nine minute cost access.
2:29:9.750 --> 2:29:18.80
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Token lifetime is 10 minutes, so you just use the refreshing point with your refresh tokens that you got from the password grant.
2:29:19.190 --> 2:29:21.940
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
But it's it's just designed patterns so.
2:29:23.830 --> 2:29:28.30
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Uh, I'm not sure that it's related to our to our issue.
2:29:43.110 --> 2:29:45.860
Flagg, Todd
So aren't you like, this is OK.
2:29:45.870 --> 2:29:49.210
Flagg, Todd
I'm man, I'm apologize that I'm asking that an absolutely stupid question here.
2:29:52.780 --> 2:29:54.830
Flagg, Todd
We initiate an authentication request.
2:29:56.790 --> 2:29:57.210
Flagg, Todd
Wait.
2:29:57.260 --> 2:30:4.560
Flagg, Todd
Uh, OK, so you're just looking at it at the ID level, but you're not seeing any kind of errors on the message that's coming back, right?
2:30:6.230 --> 2:30:9.940
Flagg, Todd
So how many requests are we actually making that are actually getting to STS?
2:30:13.40 --> 2:30:26.970
Flagg, Todd
Because we are like ultimately the process is this is that we go in, we have to grab files that are available and we are like the they're like 3 separate files.
2:30:28.770 --> 2:30:33.660
Flagg, Todd
And I I believe we're gonna have to do an authentication request each time we do that.
2:30:33.930 --> 2:30:42.590
Flagg, Todd
So in this today's issue, we had two files that were successfully retrieved using CFS and one of them failed because of this bad gateway request.
2:30:45.200 --> 2:30:48.610
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
And why you are asking for the Nikhil talking for each file.
2:30:56.890 --> 2:30:59.70
Flagg, Todd
I think the simplest answer is that we do as we're told.
2:31:1.230 --> 2:31:6.820
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Ohh, the token leaves 10 minutes, so you may use this for 10 minutes.
2:31:9.240 --> 2:31:10.880
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
I can assume for all files.
2:31:15.340 --> 2:31:24.500
Korenschi, Eduard
So definitely this is a pattern that we will have to revisit, but try to understand that, uh, this question makes sense when you consider the system isolated.
2:31:24.910 --> 2:31:32.150
Korenschi, Eduard
The thing is that we are not connecting directly to either the authentication gateway or through the CFS systems directly or stuff like that.
2:31:32.160 --> 2:31:37.10
Korenschi, Eduard
We most of the time we get it through different kind of libraries that we also have internally develop.
2:31:37.720 --> 2:31:44.60
Korenschi, Eduard
Yeah, internally means inside the circle refinitiv and when issues arise like in this case.
2:31:44.110 --> 2:31:45.390
Korenschi, Eduard
OK, everybody asked.
2:31:45.400 --> 2:31:46.650
Korenschi, Eduard
Ohh how you are you doing it?
2:31:46.660 --> 2:31:50.10
Korenschi, Eduard
Well, we just as it was shown, we open a session.
2:31:50.20 --> 2:31:55.540
Korenschi, Eduard
That session should have lived for 10 for maybe 30 minutes with automatically refreshing.
2:31:56.50 --> 2:31:59.680
Korenschi, Eduard
That's how it should, but then it breaks and when it breaks everybody's.
2:31:59.690 --> 2:32:1.60
Korenschi, Eduard
Ohh but what they are doing?
2:32:1.110 --> 2:32:4.660
Korenschi, Eduard
I think you keep the session too long open.
2:32:5.230 --> 2:32:24.420
Korenschi, Eduard
You should maybe maybe it's it's better to just close the session after every such intervention like downloading go file or pushing something somewhere and the next time you you just open a new session because it's safer, it works better and years go by and then you get to this kind of scenario which to me also it looks very strange.
2:32:24.430 --> 2:32:29.670
Korenschi, Eduard
I mean, I've seen in the in the previous log even authentications like every second, not every minute.
2:32:43.740 --> 2:32:44.80
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Umm.
2:32:30.370 --> 2:32:44.460
Korenschi, Eduard
And that's definitely not OK, but definitely nobody thought about doing it on purpose and we get to this situations because people are looking for the simplest solution to immediate issues.
2:32:44.910 --> 2:33:1.920
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
And yeah, just for your understanding, we have kind of of firewall rules on the top of STS and if the request limit reached some threshold we are simply blocking the user.
2:33:3.490 --> 2:33:20.120
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Now we have, if I'm not mistaken on the eurologic correct me, we have roughly 150 requests per 5 minutes that we allowing to user to use, but it's not the final threshold and we're about to reduce the threshold.
2:33:20.130 --> 2:33:21.300
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
And then this case.
2:33:21.310 --> 2:33:27.800
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
So if you're doing session request every second, you will be blocked.
2:33:27.810 --> 2:33:31.380
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
For sure, it's a risk for your service.
2:33:33.390 --> 2:33:35.510
Korenschi, Eduard
Yeah, it's definitely a pattern that we will have to repeat it.
2:33:33.980 --> 2:33:35.760
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
And yeah, and it's odd.
2:33:35.770 --> 2:33:44.860
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
And yeah, and it's adding more risk to our service because we're trying to protect us from outages, from overuse and wrong patterns.
2:33:59.600 --> 2:34:2.630
Korenschi, Eduard
Yeah, but this doesn't solve the this situation now.
2:34:7.520 --> 2:34:7.700
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Umm.
2:34:2.640 --> 2:34:23.350
Korenschi, Eduard
And just to answer it, because somebody else also requested some dumping of headers and the the problem with that one is again the issue that particular issue is happening like a few times a year in order to catch that situation we would have to turn to the bug level of logging for that library.
2:34:23.360 --> 2:34:38.520
Korenschi, Eduard
Again, we are not controlling the library, we can just ask for a flag to be set or unset and that will dump a huge, huge amount of logs for a huge number of months until the next time the issue appears.
2:34:38.530 --> 2:34:40.770
Korenschi, Eduard
So most probably it will never happen.
2:34:40.780 --> 2:34:41.740
Korenschi, Eduard
So we have what we have.
2:34:43.790 --> 2:34:47.550
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So what I'm saying like there is a problem with the data.
2:34:47.560 --> 2:34:48.790
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Uh, the library, right?
2:34:48.800 --> 2:34:49.680
Khunphet, Phonlawat
That you are using?
2:34:49.950 --> 2:34:52.20
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Why we want fix?
2:34:52.30 --> 2:34:53.520
Khunphet, Phonlawat
That's one export.
2:34:53.530 --> 2:35:3.620
Khunphet, Phonlawat
More information because each team right needs more information, but the library tried to hide everything, so I think it will be the problem if it happened again.
2:35:3.710 --> 2:35:6.640
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So you can imagine, right, it's still be the same.
2:35:6.990 --> 2:35:9.280
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So it happened over and over again.
2:35:9.290 --> 2:35:11.480
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Why we don't stop this loop right?
2:35:11.710 --> 2:35:18.230
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So why we don't try to make it more easier and more meaningful in the application log, right?
2:35:18.320 --> 2:35:22.330
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So I think every team try to provide a recommendation.
2:35:22.540 --> 2:35:25.70
Khunphet, Phonlawat
What either bit practice to do right?
2:35:25.80 --> 2:35:32.770
Khunphet, Phonlawat
The domain, the domain one it we need to export more information that to to make another team work together, right?
2:35:32.900 --> 2:35:37.10
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So that clearly there is no we should be the on the library.
2:35:37.220 --> 2:35:40.920
Khunphet, Phonlawat
This is from my understanding and I think we need to fix this one as well.
2:35:41.900 --> 2:35:42.890
Khunphet, Phonlawat
You know what I mean, right?
2:35:42.410 --> 2:35:52.420
Korenschi, Eduard
Yeah, we will try and I will also told that we we have to somehow to request for the ID library especially for this case is a failed authentication which seems to be like the main corporate here.
2:35:55.280 --> 2:35:55.440
Flagg, Todd
And.
2:35:52.790 --> 2:36:21.390
Korenschi, Eduard
I I mean in the in the past year, we haven't had any other major issue with them except this one where authentication fails for whatever reasons and then it's completely impossible to debug it because we only have like a status code or some towards message from that one and the responsible usually is just so in on debugging and debugging then speeds gazillions of logs across the whole library and we don't care for the whole those logs.
2:36:26.940 --> 2:36:27.970
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So sorry for interrupt.
2:36:21.400 --> 2:36:28.160
Korenschi, Eduard
So we should ask for some more granular logging from them, especially for this authentication part.
2:36:27.980 --> 2:36:35.690
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I think I think it doesn't it that we don't have to open the debugging for the whole application so we can lock when it had an error.
2:36:35.760 --> 2:36:37.350
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So you can you say, right?
2:36:37.400 --> 2:36:39.650
Khunphet, Phonlawat
It's happened maybe a few times a year.
2:36:40.10 --> 2:36:40.970
Khunphet, Phonlawat
A few times a year.
2:36:41.60 --> 2:36:46.370
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So if we just put the information in the in the exception when we got an error.
2:36:46.520 --> 2:36:49.90
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So I think it doesn't impact the whole.
2:36:57.510 --> 2:36:58.230
Korenschi, Eduard
No, maybe.
2:36:49.100 --> 2:36:59.250
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I mean the overall latency, right, because we don't debug everything, so we need to understand what is a bit packed to open open the information, right?
2:37:0.310 --> 2:37:2.80
Korenschi, Eduard
And it was a maybe misunderstanding.
2:37:8.250 --> 2:37:9.560
Khunphet, Phonlawat
We can forget one by one.
2:37:2.90 --> 2:37:9.580
Korenschi, Eduard
When I said the bug level, that doesn't mean that we start debugging it just about the level of logging that we are have to turn on, you know, and how granular that is.
2:37:9.570 --> 2:37:19.220
Khunphet, Phonlawat
We, we, we, we we need to we don't need to go everything at the one time so we can improve one by one we can forget OK we have the error right we need to open.
2:37:19.410 --> 2:37:21.980
Khunphet, Phonlawat
We need to export information when we have an error.
2:37:22.150 --> 2:37:25.80
Khunphet, Phonlawat
We need to forget all these parts first, OK?
2:37:28.590 --> 2:37:31.540
Khunphet, Phonlawat
That that's why I think we need to improve the ad library.
2:37:31.650 --> 2:37:33.140
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, you can say right.
2:37:33.150 --> 2:37:39.760
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Everyone's duck and and we cannot get the information to to test for the further step.
2:37:39.770 --> 2:37:42.790
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Right, because that isn't missing information.
2:37:48.470 --> 2:37:52.140
Flagg, Todd
I think that needs to be a separate discussion overall.
2:37:53.900 --> 2:37:59.330
Flagg, Todd
Umm can I get the log of how many times can you export that information from?
2:37:59.340 --> 2:38:6.160
Flagg, Todd
Was it STS or AAA that shows like how many times we were connecting and trying to authenticate during this time?
2:38:9.890 --> 2:38:10.90
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
And.
2:38:9.640 --> 2:38:14.150
Bey, Olga (External)
Uh, I could show you, like, send you a screen.
2:38:15.860 --> 2:38:17.680
Bey, Olga (External)
So you said that you was doing.
2:38:16.70 --> 2:38:19.620
Flagg, Todd
I prefer like a CSV if possible, like I'm ultimately like.
2:38:19.630 --> 2:38:35.420
Flagg, Todd
I'm just trying to get to the point of like in my brain, I'm trying to figure out like our application, all it needs to do is connect to CFS, get some data umm and then reconnects and then I think it's actually going into.
2:38:35.430 --> 2:38:37.750
Flagg, Todd
It's helping to facilitate a connection to grab some files.
2:38:39.220 --> 2:38:48.20
Flagg, Todd
So if we're making, you know, I'm sorry if you said I think you actually said there were there were connections every second during a period of time.
2:38:48.30 --> 2:38:53.890
Flagg, Todd
I'd love to know how many connections were authentication requests were being made, and if there's any kind of file limit there.
2:38:55.400 --> 2:39:3.670
Flagg, Todd
The only thing I would expect and maybe this is something that again through the already Lib is that I would expect that there be an error message that says threshold hit.
2:39:3.760 --> 2:39:7.980
Flagg, Todd
If we if we hit the Max number of authentication request like that's pretty.
2:39:6.910 --> 2:39:8.820
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
You're not blocked as if no.
2:39:8.860 --> 2:39:12.740
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Yeah, you're not blocked as if now, so you will receive the proper error.
2:39:12.750 --> 2:39:16.690
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
But the question how this library is bull process this error?
2:39:17.840 --> 2:39:20.810
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
And another question. Yeah.
2:39:21.640 --> 2:39:22.350
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Do you know?
2:39:20.720 --> 2:39:23.330
Flagg, Todd
Well, the library the library is just a proxy.
2:39:22.400 --> 2:39:24.180
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Yeah, yeah.
2:39:23.560 --> 2:39:30.600
Flagg, Todd
Yeah, the, I mean basically it's just gonna pass through whatever has been what has been getting displayed from the source and destination.
2:39:33.270 --> 2:39:41.850
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
And also the question didn't know if the right any retries on the top of failures.
2:39:48.910 --> 2:39:49.160
Flagg, Todd
Umm.
2:39:49.400 --> 2:39:50.190
Korenschi, Eduard
And there are some.
2:39:44.510 --> 2:39:51.440
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Let's say if there is a kind of network flopping something that we cannot call.
2:39:51.710 --> 2:39:52.610
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Yeah. Uh-huh.
2:39:51.500 --> 2:39:57.760
Korenschi, Eduard
Is there are in some cases, but they also have some logical for that we've had this kind of discussions before.
2:39:58.170 --> 2:39:58.430
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Mm-hmm.
2:39:58.60 --> 2:39:59.270
Korenschi, Eduard
The situation is the following.
2:39:59.280 --> 2:40:7.310
Korenschi, Eduard
Sometimes errors are recoverable, yeah, but because it just as you said, it could be just a link or something temporary.
2:40:5.970 --> 2:40:7.440
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Umm hmm.
2:40:7.480 --> 2:40:15.250
Korenschi, Eduard
But there are some other errors which if you could try you will get to blocked accounts or to deplete the resources.
2:40:14.480 --> 2:40:17.370
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
How we're yeah, we're recommending to do it for.
2:40:15.580 --> 2:40:17.560
Korenschi, Eduard
So because of this they have some tests.
2:40:21.880 --> 2:40:22.130
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
He.
2:40:19.500 --> 2:40:24.880
Korenschi, Eduard
Yeah, because of this, they have some tests the and sometimes they retry, sometimes they don't.
2:40:25.140 --> 2:40:37.560
Korenschi, Eduard
Depending on this understanding and there were some have a situation in the past, like actually a simple error was must under some access denied error or something like that.
2:40:38.730 --> 2:40:39.330
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Umm.
2:40:37.620 --> 2:40:43.0
Korenschi, Eduard
Message for whatever reasons, programming bugs and because of this trial didn't happen.
2:40:44.400 --> 2:40:44.870
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Yeah.
2:40:44.880 --> 2:40:45.250
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Yeah.
2:40:44.210 --> 2:40:45.510
Korenschi, Eduard
But in this case I don't know.
2:40:45.260 --> 2:40:51.470
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
And we are we are recommending to use limited number of retries and all the constant retry.
2:40:51.540 --> 2:40:52.920
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
But let's say 3 retries.
2:40:54.500 --> 2:40:55.710
Flagg, Todd
Yeah, I think that's the case.
2:40:55.10 --> 2:40:56.660
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
It won't, yeah.
2:40:55.720 --> 2:40:57.330
Flagg, Todd
Unfortunately, certain it's not gonna.
2:40:58.180 --> 2:40:59.970
Flagg, Todd
I'm virtually certain it's not gonna like.
2:40:59.980 --> 2:41:7.890
Flagg, Todd
It's not a perpetual kind of retry mechanism where it's gonna keep retrying until something forces to stop.
2:41:7.900 --> 2:41:10.440
Flagg, Todd
I'm pretty certain it's limited to like 3 if I can remember correctly.
2:41:12.400 --> 2:41:12.750
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
Uh.
2:41:12.800 --> 2:41:14.610
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
Hello Todd, it's Mitra from SS test team.
2:41:14.620 --> 2:41:15.150
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
Can you hear me now?
2:41:15.960 --> 2:41:16.80
Flagg, Todd
Yes.
2:41:18.540 --> 2:41:19.60
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Welcome.
2:41:17.640 --> 2:41:22.70
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
Do you guys have the exact time when the issue started and they ended?
2:41:22.480 --> 2:41:22.720
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
Hello.
2:41:27.50 --> 2:41:29.40
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Yeah, it was specific.
2:41:24.370 --> 2:41:29.140
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
I mean, was it some specific period of time or or your experience in this issue till now?
2:41:29.760 --> 2:41:32.890
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Specific periods of time and it's, uh.
2:41:32.900 --> 2:41:40.240
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Happens just once per day, so it's difficult to have to confirm if it's still in place.
2:41:38.650 --> 2:41:40.450
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
So it's happening every day or?
2:41:41.170 --> 2:41:41.920
Flagg, Todd
Not that.
2:41:41.930 --> 2:41:42.780
Flagg, Todd
So it happened today.
2:41:41.680 --> 2:41:44.170
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Was there process happened?
2:41:47.100 --> 2:41:47.300
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
Umm.
2:41:44.240 --> 2:41:54.750
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
The process happened every day and issue happening few times per year and the timing, as you're discovered the same.
2:41:54.760 --> 2:41:57.190
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Then we had the kind of bleep in.
2:41:59.30 --> 2:42:0.830
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
AW's or at the network?
2:42:2.240 --> 2:42:2.640
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
Yeah.
2:42:5.540 --> 2:42:6.740
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Umm.
2:42:2.690 --> 2:42:8.840
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
Yeah, that's that's what I actually was was trying to say that there has been some delay in responses.
2:42:8.850 --> 2:42:22.900
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
That does not seem like related to STS service, but more to the layer between Q and STS which basically load balancer and we were not able to identify any issues in our application.
2:42:22.910 --> 2:42:23.460
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
From what I see.
2:42:24.240 --> 2:42:36.240
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
Uh, in our systems and it doesn't seem like we we like STS have sent this file too, but most likely this was a load balancer who have who might send this.
2:42:38.290 --> 2:42:40.140
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
Yeah, I I fully agree with Lana.
2:42:38.930 --> 2:42:43.560
Flagg, Todd
And is this a load balancer on the Rd, the RDP gateway or something?
2:42:42.990 --> 2:42:44.420
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
No, no.
2:42:44.430 --> 2:42:46.180
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
Most likely it's STS load balancer.
2:42:46.190 --> 2:42:47.600
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
I'm currently trying to find it.
2:42:48.180 --> 2:42:48.420
Flagg, Todd
OK.
2:42:48.570 --> 2:42:52.320
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
Can you can you let me know the exact time? Yep.
2:42:51.750 --> 2:42:52.890
Flagg, Todd
Uh, I think it was a.
2:42:48.680 --> 2:42:55.730
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
But little one more thing that it's it's US region usage only from the.
2:42:55.810 --> 2:43:0.170
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
From that I can see and also from the logs that he was shared.
2:43:8.820 --> 2:43:9.30
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
Umm.
2:43:0.180 --> 2:43:13.90
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
So there was the Python exception that occurred in 112133 about that, so it's not pretty much much in our timing.
2:43:13.830 --> 2:43:14.70
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
Well.
2:43:13.100 --> 2:43:17.720
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
So maybe error was in the 37 but the exception was in the 33.
2:43:19.20 --> 2:43:19.470
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
OK.
2:43:19.600 --> 2:43:20.670
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
OK, understood.
2:43:20.720 --> 2:43:22.440
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
So again, like you're saying that.
2:43:24.300 --> 2:43:29.840
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
Client traffic is mainly in US, but we had that blip in Europe, TS, right?
2:43:30.600 --> 2:43:31.140
Vilchynskyi, Yurii (External)
Yeah, right.
2:43:32.40 --> 2:43:32.730
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
OK, understood.
2:43:33.840 --> 2:43:46.530
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
Uh, I'm actually trying to check the amount of five execs we've been serving today on that 11111121, and it doesn't seem like it was a huge one, right?
2:43:46.540 --> 2:43:59.730
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
So I'm checking Europe and it says like up to 10/5 execs that STS have sent while while serving like more than 30,000 requests at that point.
2:43:59.960 --> 2:44:2.170
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
So it doesn't seem like it was something global.
2:44:2.580 --> 2:44:4.130
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
I OK, yeah, there is.
2:44:4.200 --> 2:44:5.810
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
There is also no there is.
2:44:5.880 --> 2:44:12.910
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
There were 352 five execs by load balancer in Ireland in Europe STS.
2:44:13.240 --> 2:44:19.710
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
So since you are coming via the RDP gateway, there is a pretty high chance you could land on any stress region.
2:44:20.40 --> 2:44:24.780
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
I wouldn't say there is no possibility you can lend lend on STS.
2:44:24.910 --> 2:44:28.390
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
You are so that should be fine.
2:44:28.450 --> 2:44:41.320
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
I I would not rule it out, so I believe that you've you've you've made you're basically hit that 355 exacts from SS load balancer.
2:44:41.870 --> 2:44:52.600
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
We will still have to to understand what was the reason for this, but I fully agree with silana having a retry with an exponential backoff would be very beneficial here.
2:44:53.250 --> 2:44:56.540
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
So this is basically jitter mechanism.
2:44:56.550 --> 2:45:10.330
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
If you need more details, Todd, I can, I can share with you, but basically it's saying that you make retry, you wait some time then you make retry and then you basically multiply the the time and eventually you should you should get the response.
2:45:10.790 --> 2:45:24.0
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
I can see that that spike happened only within within a single minute, so it was not, uh, something that that took a lot of time, but rather a very short spike of 5X on our side.
2:45:25.190 --> 2:45:30.790
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I have one question that are you able do you have the WAV WAV attack into the load balancer right?
2:45:31.840 --> 2:45:33.410
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
Yes, yes, that's for sure.
2:45:32.30 --> 2:45:35.140
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I'm wondering about AELB law order while block.
2:45:35.150 --> 2:45:35.880
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Something like that.
2:45:35.890 --> 2:45:37.430
Khunphet, Phonlawat
It is possible for you to check on that.
2:45:38.510 --> 2:45:39.360
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
Yeah, we will.
2:45:39.370 --> 2:45:44.80
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
We will, we will be able to check it on the Feather investigation and that's for sure.
2:45:44.90 --> 2:45:47.220
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
A single place where we could see the reason for those five execs.
2:45:47.390 --> 2:45:48.540
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
However, as you might know.
2:45:50.300 --> 2:45:57.90
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
We as a developer does not have a direct access to a W as developer role which could allow us to get those logs.
2:45:57.180 --> 2:46:5.720
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
So we'll probably need to work with Azure team to run a few queries there to extract those five execs, which is not a very fast thing as you can imagine.
2:46:6.690 --> 2:46:7.450
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I see. OK.
2:46:9.150 --> 2:46:9.510
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
Yeah. So.
2:46:8.290 --> 2:46:10.720
Flagg, Todd
When can we get that kind of like?
2:46:15.720 --> 2:46:15.950
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
Umm.
2:46:10.730 --> 2:46:29.580
Flagg, Todd
Ultimately, I just need to make sure because this is gonna come up as some sort of review and to be completely honest with you, I I I hate to even mention this, but because of some of the issues we've had in the past with AAA umm, my boss is getting yelled at by Fiona to.
2:46:31.590 --> 2:46:32.720
Flagg, Todd
Keep track of this stuff.
2:46:32.730 --> 2:46:34.420
Flagg, Todd
So I know this stuff is gonna come back to me.
2:46:35.770 --> 2:46:36.0
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
Umm.
2:46:34.840 --> 2:46:37.490
Flagg, Todd
O, so I need to get.
2:46:38.100 --> 2:46:40.730
Flagg, Todd
I need to kind of get this kind of locked down.
2:46:41.890 --> 2:46:42.620
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
No, that's fine.
2:46:41.700 --> 2:46:42.710
Flagg, Todd
Like, how do we get this?
2:46:42.630 --> 2:46:45.240
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
I'm going to provide a full RCA on this.
2:46:45.790 --> 2:46:45.990
Flagg, Todd
OK.
2:46:45.310 --> 2:46:46.890
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
Uh, what was the reason for that?
2:46:46.970 --> 2:46:49.160
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
I'm not promising you this in hours, right?
2:46:49.170 --> 2:46:53.100
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
I would probably measure it in in a in a day or something, right?
2:46:53.350 --> 2:46:53.530
Flagg, Todd
OK.
2:46:53.310 --> 2:46:57.600
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
As I said, approved like the extraction those logs might take time.
2:46:58.110 --> 2:46:58.400
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
Yeah.
2:47:6.250 --> 2:47:6.470
Flagg, Todd
Hmm.
2:46:58.410 --> 2:47:7.920
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
We just identified that there was a large amount like not large, but again 305 or fours on a single minute in STS Europe.
2:47:8.350 --> 2:47:23.930
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
Again, compared to 30,000 requests per minute, we were serving at that at that moment, we will probably have to engage with adwas support for this because again, no obvious reason why STS would send this because we didn't see any spikes in CPU.
2:47:23.940 --> 2:47:25.590
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
Any sort of metrics, right?
2:47:25.860 --> 2:47:34.620
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
So we probably will need to raise a business in part question with STS you can put, I would say let's have a let's have a.
2:47:35.260 --> 2:47:44.630
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
Uh, let's have a PR for this and we basically going to have, uh, a investigation on our side and we will provide an orca in this.
2:47:45.510 --> 2:47:50.780
Flagg, Todd
Is this part of a larger PIR that was affecting other applications?
2:47:52.140 --> 2:47:52.390
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
No.
2:47:50.790 --> 2:47:53.110
Flagg, Todd
I guess and how to end should be wrapping this.
2:47:53.600 --> 2:47:53.960
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Umm.
2:47:57.130 --> 2:47:57.360
Flagg, Todd
Hmm.
2:47:59.870 --> 2:48:0.90
Flagg, Todd
OK.
2:47:54.680 --> 2:48:1.260
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
I don't see any other applications knocking knocking to us with this, so no again like.
2:48:0.390 --> 2:48:2.50
Miller, Laurence
Looks like it's just us tonight.
2:48:2.830 --> 2:48:3.10
Flagg, Todd
OK.
2:48:2.60 --> 2:48:5.740
Miller, Laurence
So we'll need to to do that.
2:48:5.750 --> 2:48:7.60
Miller, Laurence
We're gonna need to get this.
2:48:7.530 --> 2:48:10.580
Miller, Laurence
We're gonna need to get this incident elevated. Up to it.
2:48:10.930 --> 2:48:13.580
Miller, Laurence
It should be P3 anyway, but we're gonna have to get it.
2:48:13.890 --> 2:48:15.790
Miller, Laurence
Request to get a PR done in it as well.
2:48:16.840 --> 2:48:17.40
Flagg, Todd
Yep.
2:48:19.490 --> 2:48:20.300
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
Yeah, that is for sure.
2:48:20.310 --> 2:48:27.700
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
But again, like most likely that the other team did not know, because for example if we take a workspace we generate 95% of the traffic to STS.
2:48:27.950 --> 2:48:33.760
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
The reason why we still are not sitting on the TRT related to the workspace is because they have a retry policy.
2:48:34.90 --> 2:48:46.700
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
They are doing the same authentication as you, but they're they're making three retries within a single minute, making refresh and like when these kind of events happens, this does not.
2:48:46.810 --> 2:48:51.10
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
Again, I strongly suspect that this was mainly related with some edible thing.
2:48:52.770 --> 2:49:1.820
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
At at like at his second or third retry, they have saved their flow and thus we we don't see them here.
2:49:2.290 --> 2:49:4.300
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
So yeah, I would.
2:49:4.380 --> 2:49:8.960
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
I would like to you guys probably to to consider having a.
2:49:9.0 --> 2:49:15.110
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
Also, it's a task for yourself to review the retry mechanism on your site.
2:49:16.670 --> 2:49:17.240
Flagg, Todd
That's fine.
2:49:17.250 --> 2:49:18.610
Flagg, Todd
We can review this.
2:49:28.600 --> 2:49:29.760
Flagg, Todd
OK, so I guess.
2:49:32.330 --> 2:49:32.670
Flagg, Todd
What?
2:49:32.680 --> 2:49:33.10
Flagg, Todd
Lawrence.
2:49:33.20 --> 2:49:34.60
Flagg, Todd
What's what's my next like?
2:49:34.70 --> 2:49:36.770
Flagg, Todd
How do I make sure that we get this like set up as a PR?
2:49:38.730 --> 2:49:39.380
Miller, Laurence
We'll have to.
2:49:39.420 --> 2:49:41.80
Miller, Laurence
We'll have to check it on level.
2:49:41.90 --> 2:49:47.20
Miller, Laurence
Look, cause we're first of all we need to check the reticule.
2:49:47.30 --> 2:49:53.250
Miller, Laurence
Scroll up this chat and get the actual incident reference for this, because there's two incidents in here, isn't there now?
2:49:54.650 --> 2:50:6.390
Miller, Laurence
Just checking this once, at least the P3 cause it probably hasn't been marked the P3 yet, and then we'll have to contact the problem to him and ask him to to do the to do the arranged PIR.
2:50:7.560 --> 2:50:19.40
Miller, Laurence
But I'm not sure if they may ask that we have to elevate it up to apply free hypo for them to for them to take on the PIR, but I'll find that out from them.
2:50:30.730 --> 2:50:30.900
Flagg, Todd
And.
2:50:25.750 --> 2:50:35.910
Miller, Laurence
Because to have done that, we would have to, we would have had to have had this elevated to a major incident, but I'm hoping they won't need that for us to request a PPI and AP33.
2:50:36.350 --> 2:50:38.320
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
So maybe it be 3 hypo.
2:50:41.930 --> 2:50:44.440
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Now the major one, but still under PR.
2:50:50.110 --> 2:50:50.520
Miller, Laurence
Yeah.
2:50:50.570 --> 2:50:54.40
Miller, Laurence
Yeah, but P, 3 hype I would have had to have been accepted into the major incident team.
2:50:54.620 --> 2:50:55.320
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Yeah, yeah.
2:50:54.50 --> 2:50:55.530
Miller, Laurence
Yeah, we have.
2:50:55.540 --> 2:50:57.980
Miller, Laurence
We haven't gone through that process for this ticket because we didn't.
2:50:58.330 --> 2:50:58.510
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Umm.
2:50:58.470 --> 2:50:59.220
Miller, Laurence
We didn't do it.
2:50:59.230 --> 2:51:4.40
Miller, Laurence
Feel it necessary at the time, but to get a PIR done we may have to go through that, but we don't need to.
2:51:3.960 --> 2:51:4.160
Belkina, Svitlana (External)
Umm.
2:51:4.50 --> 2:51:7.800
Miller, Laurence
Everybody holding on this to to to sort that out.
2:51:14.180 --> 2:51:23.370
Miller, Laurence
If somebody on the FLS team could just check that the incident that both the incidents in this actually are both listed as P, freeze please.
2:51:24.420 --> 2:51:24.690
Miller, Laurence
This.
2:51:25.120 --> 2:51:25.740
N U, Chandu (External)
OK, let me check.
2:51:32.420 --> 2:51:33.60
Miller, Laurence
And just confirm.
2:51:56.950 --> 2:51:57.110
N U, Chandu (External)
So.
2:51:52.950 --> 2:52:4.30
Flagg, Todd
So and the last thing is is that so I was taking notes for actions on my team, but I don't know if anyone had from L2 was taking notes from any wider group.
2:52:6.540 --> 2:52:6.880
N U, Chandu (External)
Uh.
2:52:7.140 --> 2:52:8.70
N U, Chandu (External)
Ticket status.
2:52:8.80 --> 2:52:9.350
N U, Chandu (External)
I can see there's B4.
2:52:9.360 --> 2:52:10.420
N U, Chandu (External)
Should I make it as a P3?
2:52:10.900 --> 2:52:11.830
Miller, Laurence
Yes, please.
2:52:11.900 --> 2:52:12.130
Flagg, Todd
It's.
2:52:12.160 --> 2:52:13.310
N U, Chandu (External)
Both incidents, right?
2:52:12.60 --> 2:52:13.510
Miller, Laurence
There should be 2 incidents.
2:52:13.860 --> 2:52:14.40
N U, Chandu (External)
Yeah.
2:52:15.40 --> 2:52:17.580
N U, Chandu (External)
Yeah, look at make it correct.
2:52:13.580 --> 2:52:21.540
Miller, Laurence
There should be 2 incidents, one for the performance issue and one for the and one for the missing file issue.
2:52:22.70 --> 2:52:22.300
N U, Chandu (External)
Better.
2:52:21.610 --> 2:52:23.440
Miller, Laurence
We we need them both as P threes, please.
2:52:23.800 --> 2:52:24.640
N U, Chandu (External)
Sure, I'll do that.
2:52:25.570 --> 2:52:25.930
Miller, Laurence
Thank you.
2:52:55.590 --> 2:52:58.230
Miller, Laurence
So so as far as this point is concerned, it sounds like.
2:53:3.800 --> 2:53:4.0
Flagg, Todd
Yep.
2:53:0.540 --> 2:53:5.800
Miller, Laurence
Demetros doing some further investigation and we'll come back with some root cause analysis.
2:53:6.650 --> 2:53:6.830
Flagg, Todd
Yep.
2:53:15.230 --> 2:53:15.450
Flagg, Todd
Yeah.
2:53:7.440 --> 2:53:15.730
Miller, Laurence
There's also gonna be some pickups from our side to to potentially do some code rewrites to put in these retries and it's slightly different way.
2:53:15.740 --> 2:53:16.660
Miller, Laurence
Yeah, at some point.
2:53:18.900 --> 2:53:22.230
Miller, Laurence
Is that it for this particular incident, I'll just clean it.
2:53:22.410 --> 2:53:25.900
Flagg, Todd
Because so I need to, yeah.
2:53:22.240 --> 2:53:26.150
Miller, Laurence
We just need to review what needs to be done for the performance.
2:53:26.160 --> 2:53:32.340
Miller, Laurence
One as well, because we sort of jumped off that onto this before we finished off what everybody was gonna go and do on that one.
2:53:33.490 --> 2:53:33.800
Flagg, Todd
Yeah.
2:53:34.310 --> 2:53:36.50
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
No, nothing from my side.
2:53:33.810 --> 2:53:38.510
Flagg, Todd
So at least eight a couple notes of things to go through my go through with my team.
2:53:39.550 --> 2:53:40.270
Flagg, Todd
Umm.
2:53:40.530 --> 2:53:45.230
Flagg, Todd
And at least one thing to follow up with the party library team with as well.
2:53:49.270 --> 2:53:49.730
Flagg, Todd
Umm.
2:53:49.280 --> 2:53:52.980
Miller, Laurence
That that should still be an action item from the from the previous Pyaru I think, isn't it?
2:53:57.900 --> 2:54:1.190
Flagg, Todd
This was actually just with this call today.
2:54:2.770 --> 2:54:5.290
Flagg, Todd
It's a follow up with the ID library team on one thing.
2:54:7.400 --> 2:54:7.650
Miller, Laurence
What?
2:54:8.630 --> 2:54:9.310
Flagg, Todd
Ohm.
2:54:14.740 --> 2:54:15.590
Flagg, Todd
To stay focused.
2:54:15.600 --> 2:54:19.140
Flagg, Todd
Uh, yeah, I mean, I guess we can drop off on the stuff on the performance bit.
2:54:21.240 --> 2:54:21.520
Flagg, Todd
Sorry.
2:54:22.110 --> 2:54:24.510
Flagg, Todd
Umm, I forget where we were on that one.
2:54:27.910 --> 2:54:28.90
Flagg, Todd
Yeah.
2:54:26.280 --> 2:54:42.490
Korenschi, Eduard
On the performance part, the performance part self will have to fix the the look look you look up for five sets by accessing the CFS API directly, not just iterating over all existing file sets.
2:54:48.410 --> 2:54:48.610
Flagg, Todd
Yep.
2:54:54.390 --> 2:54:54.920
Flagg, Todd
Yep.
2:54:54.970 --> 2:54:59.170
Flagg, Todd
Ohh yeah, I put those notes down, didn't I? Yeah.
2:54:43.280 --> 2:55:6.870
Korenschi, Eduard
But that probably will take a long time, specially because during their release cycle and stuff like that and the on our end, then we'll have to look for an alternative way through the ID library to check to access CFS because we don't have any other uh access to CFS and we'll try to do it R, library way and yeah, check the for that existence.
2:55:7.190 --> 2:55:8.600
Flagg, Todd
And then there's the pagination thing.
2:55:10.270 --> 2:55:10.870
Miller, Laurence
What's that?
2:55:8.610 --> 2:55:12.350
Flagg, Todd
I think that was suggested to evaluate, right? That's.
2:55:15.10 --> 2:55:15.170
Flagg, Todd
Yeah.
2:55:17.890 --> 2:55:18.30
Flagg, Todd
Yeah.
2:55:10.760 --> 2:55:18.560
Korenschi, Eduard
That was that was, uh, small improvement over the current implementation, but you will not bring really significant benefits it's like.
2:55:17.850 --> 2:55:22.460
Miller, Laurence
So so that that doesn't seem like that's gonna get done too quickly either.
2:55:22.750 --> 2:55:27.820
Miller, Laurence
So what do we do on the basis that that performance is progressively getting slower and slower?
2:55:27.830 --> 2:55:29.360
Miller, Laurence
And So what can we do or anything?
2:55:29.370 --> 2:55:29.770
Miller, Laurence
Can we do?
2:55:29.450 --> 2:55:47.770
Korenschi, Eduard
So what we can do immediately we we need to move as fast as possible and use another mechanism for detecting the files file set exists which is through the library and this probably isn't, but we were gonna have have to push the hot fix to the prod so.
2:55:46.800 --> 2:55:53.960
Flagg, Todd
So the thing I didn't get a chance to and I mean I guess the rest of the team, the rest of the non involved in the performance issue, you can probably drop off this call at the moment.
2:55:55.610 --> 2:55:55.840
Miller, Laurence
Yeah.
2:55:55.790 --> 2:55:57.350
Flagg, Todd
Umm, because we're gonna revisit.
2:55:55.850 --> 2:55:57.700
Miller, Laurence
Thanks to everybody that's been included on.
2:55:58.250 --> 2:55:58.550
Miller, Laurence
Yeah.
2:55:58.560 --> 2:56:3.220
Miller, Laurence
Thanks for everybody that's been on an included in the missing files investigation.
2:56:3.230 --> 2:56:3.930
Miller, Laurence
Thank you very much.
2:56:5.460 --> 2:56:8.80
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I'm not much like I can ask something more.
2:56:9.60 --> 2:56:9.830
Miller, Laurence
Course can, yeah.
2:56:8.450 --> 2:56:12.540
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Umm, I actually found the safe side right?
2:56:12.550 --> 2:56:16.350
Khunphet, Phonlawat
That is like a you you trying to scan the file from.
2:56:16.550 --> 2:56:19.80
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Let's say you scan file set under the bucket right.
2:56:19.500 --> 2:56:22.400
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Umm that is another workflow.
2:56:22.410 --> 2:56:42.90
Khunphet, Phonlawat
For example, if the publisher like profit, the file to CS and make it available and if you use the file notification feature so you are receiving the file ID that it available and then you can download directly without go to to scan the file set something like that.
2:56:42.220 --> 2:56:52.640
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So let's say every time the publisher made the file set available, then you will get the notification and then you will get that information to download the file directly.
2:56:55.350 --> 2:56:59.790
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So that's why I need to understand for your use case, yeah.
2:57:1.710 --> 2:57:3.390
Korenschi, Eduard
Well, no, it it's OK.
2:57:3.400 --> 2:57:6.140
Korenschi, Eduard
It's the only explanation here given by the self.
2:57:6.150 --> 2:57:6.420
Korenschi, Eduard
Uh.
2:57:6.430 --> 2:57:13.670
Korenschi, Eduard
Was that, uh there implementation of offering that functionality again we cannot connect to CFS directly in this context.
2:57:14.360 --> 2:57:30.460
Korenschi, Eduard
So we are using the this thin wrapper that hey they have built on top and their explanation was that they built it quite a few years ago when probably CFS didn't support the listing of file sets filtering by bucket name and fileset name.
2:57:31.70 --> 2:57:32.90
Korenschi, Eduard
Maybe so, maybe not.
2:57:32.100 --> 2:57:32.550
Korenschi, Eduard
We do.
2:57:32.690 --> 2:57:42.50
Korenschi, Eduard
It's not important why the the situation is that definitely looking at those logs that you have presented, they are downloading the whole bucket and they are not.
2:57:42.640 --> 2:57:54.440
Korenschi, Eduard
Yeah, if you are looking for a file set by name, they will not use the proper query and they will just list all the file sets in the bucket and then look at them by hand, which definitely cannot scale.
2:57:54.450 --> 2:57:54.830
Korenschi, Eduard
Uh.
2:57:54.840 --> 2:57:55.540
Korenschi, Eduard
In the long run.
2:57:55.550 --> 2:58:0.120
Korenschi, Eduard
So yeah, that that's where I understand about the using the.
2:58:0.190 --> 2:58:7.90
Korenschi, Eduard
The other approach of publisher and subscriber, but we are not using it doesn't make sense in our use case at all O,.
2:58:6.540 --> 2:58:10.980
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Give me I need to get the the maybe in the path as well or something like that.
2:58:12.910 --> 2:58:14.570
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Umm I I got your pie.
2:58:16.560 --> 2:58:16.920
Korenschi, Eduard
Yeah.
2:58:16.930 --> 2:58:18.590
Korenschi, Eduard
Well, I would get their part.
2:58:18.600 --> 2:58:20.820
Korenschi, Eduard
Well, let's hope that the rogue library fixes that.
2:58:25.180 --> 2:58:25.680
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Umm OK.
2:58:20.890 --> 2:58:29.0
Korenschi, Eduard
Has the proper implementation and we'll try to use it properly today or tomorrow we'll get an an answer if we can do it that way or no.
2:58:28.800 --> 2:58:31.260
Flagg, Todd
The the only thing I wanted to raise earlier.
2:58:32.830 --> 2:58:35.940
Flagg, Todd
Edward, is that it has gotten worse, right?
2:58:36.690 --> 2:58:40.50
Flagg, Todd
We basically doubled the time that it's taken.
2:58:39.190 --> 2:58:45.440
Korenschi, Eduard
Yes, it got one worse because she we are pushing more and more files as every time we publish things.
2:58:46.70 --> 2:58:46.230
Flagg, Todd
Yeah.
2:58:45.610 --> 2:58:50.230
Korenschi, Eduard
So they are downloading every time more and more files five sets.
2:58:51.620 --> 2:58:56.10
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, if you're trying to download all the files, I mean all the files under the bucket.
2:58:56.20 --> 2:59:1.560
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, they're pretty sure that it will take more time depending on the number of file in there, right? Yeah.
2:59:3.750 --> 2:59:8.690
Flagg, Todd
Is there no short term solution that we could do to limit this?
2:59:9.870 --> 2:59:10.960
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Umm I.
2:59:10.110 --> 2:59:13.260
Korenschi, Eduard
I, as I said again, we're going to the proper way of doing it.
2:59:13.270 --> 2:59:17.350
Korenschi, Eduard
So trying to doing so, the ID library, which hopefully doesn't download the hot pocket.
2:59:19.10 --> 2:59:19.290
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Mm-hmm.
2:59:18.680 --> 2:59:20.410
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
Uh, sorry guys for interrupting.
2:59:21.140 --> 2:59:26.40
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
Taught Lawrence, do you guys feel like you still need AAA team on this call?
2:59:26.720 --> 2:59:26.920
Flagg, Todd
No.
2:59:26.930 --> 2:59:28.280
Miller, Laurence
Now you now you can.
2:59:28.330 --> 2:59:30.230
Miller, Laurence
You can go 33.
2:59:29.900 --> 2:59:30.250
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
OK.
2:59:30.240 --> 2:59:30.850
Miller, Laurence
Thank you very much.
2:59:30.320 --> 2:59:31.690
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
Yeah, I would appreciate.
2:59:29.710 --> 2:59:32.430
Flagg, Todd
Yeah, sorry, this is a separate issue that got raised overly. Yep.
2:59:32.470 --> 2:59:32.990
Miller, Laurence
Yeah, yeah.
2:59:32.200 --> 2:59:40.550
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
I would appreciate if you guys could include as much information as possible in terms of what kind of issues you had, what was the time, what was the request and what was the response.
2:59:40.640 --> 2:59:49.910
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
This would allow us to have a better RCA like root cause your issue and then it it should.
2:59:50.40 --> 2:59:52.560
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
It should be on on the single page, so I would appreciate.
2:59:59.320 --> 2:59:59.630
Flagg, Todd
Umm.
3:0:0.350 --> 3:0:0.950
Miller, Laurence
Demetro.
3:0:6.50 --> 3:0:9.740
Flagg, Todd
But typically it's L2 that puts together any kind of notes on these items.
3:0:12.660 --> 3:0:16.810
Flagg, Todd
Usually, though, the note taker and the UM, the leader of the the recovery call.
3:0:18.60 --> 3:0:19.520
Miller, Laurence
We still got somebody on here from there.
3:0:20.430 --> 3:0:22.400
Kurandwad, Sushant (External)
Right. Yes.
3:0:22.670 --> 3:0:26.490
Kurandwad, Sushant (External)
So we have taken notes on one note, so we'll summarize this answer what I need.
3:0:26.770 --> 3:0:27.60
Flagg, Todd
OK.
3:0:27.930 --> 3:0:28.30
N U, Chandu (External)
Yeah.
3:0:27.610 --> 3:0:31.420
Flagg, Todd
And you have the logs and all the ID's that were kind of shared with in the chat hopefully.
3:0:32.420 --> 3:0:32.550
Kurandwad, Sushant (External)
Yes.
3:0:33.320 --> 3:0:33.520
Flagg, Todd
OK.
3:0:34.780 --> 3:0:36.70
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
Uh, yeah, Todd.
3:0:34.380 --> 3:0:38.360
Flagg, Todd
OK, please show those with me, Shashank.
3:0:39.240 --> 3:0:43.10
Flagg, Todd
And we will and I'll make sure that everything looks right, OK.
3:0:44.20 --> 3:0:44.570
Khunphet, Phonlawat
And I need.
3:0:44.580 --> 3:0:45.290
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I need to go.
3:0:45.650 --> 3:0:46.300
Khunphet, Phonlawat
OK.
3:0:46.310 --> 3:0:46.740
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Go ahead. Sorry.
3:0:43.820 --> 3:0:47.50
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
But one more thing for my side sorry sorry.
3:0:47.60 --> 3:0:56.610
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
One more thing for my side has been discussed when when I just joined the call, there was quite few requests for that UID right after that.
3:0:56.620 --> 3:1:11.820
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
So we're speaking like about 20 requests within a short period of time, so we will probably share more details and get back with you to you to see if you could switch to refresh Grant instead of password grant for that. OK.
3:1:12.990 --> 3:1:13.590
Flagg, Todd
Yeah, that's fine.
3:1:14.580 --> 3:1:15.490
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
OK, awesome.
3:1:15.680 --> 3:1:17.30
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
In this case, thanks everyone.
3:1:18.40 --> 3:1:19.370
N U, Chandu (External)
And one question.
3:1:17.500 --> 3:1:19.410
Havrylevych, Dmytro (External)
I'll ask Freeplay team to drop.
3:1:20.550 --> 3:1:20.870
Flagg, Todd
Thank you.
3:1:19.720 --> 3:1:23.100
N U, Chandu (External)
So L2 is gonna send a summary right for both issues our mail.
3:1:24.930 --> 3:1:25.620
Kurandwad, Sushant (External)
Right this.
3:1:26.40 --> 3:1:26.360
N U, Chandu (External)
OK.
3:1:26.370 --> 3:1:26.770
N U, Chandu (External)
Thank you.
3:1:26.820 --> 3:1:28.220
N U, Chandu (External)
So that I can update the ticket as well.
3:1:29.420 --> 3:1:29.780
Kurandwad, Sushant (External)
Faces.
3:1:30.350 --> 3:1:30.610
N U, Chandu (External)
Yeah.
3:1:30.620 --> 3:1:30.930
N U, Chandu (External)
Thank you.
3:1:30.630 --> 3:1:33.280
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I I think to I think to need to maintain something right.
3:1:33.460 --> 3:1:50.450
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I'm not sure that when you get the the fiset it's possible to Superfly attribute, so when you specify attribute so it can reduce the number of the file set in the bucket in case you decide that it's a different attribute for the number of the fileset.
3:1:53.500 --> 3:1:55.780
Khunphet, Phonlawat
You you know the the faucet attribute, right?
3:1:58.400 --> 3:1:58.670
Korenschi, Eduard
Yeah.
3:1:58.680 --> 3:1:59.10
Korenschi, Eduard
So what?
3:1:59.20 --> 3:1:59.170
Korenschi, Eduard
What?
3:1:59.180 --> 3:2:0.230
Korenschi, Eduard
What's the sorry again?
3:2:0.240 --> 3:2:0.510
Korenschi, Eduard
What?
3:2:0.520 --> 3:2:1.540
Korenschi, Eduard
What you were saying?
3:2:2.100 --> 3:2:2.430
Khunphet, Phonlawat
OK.
3:2:2.440 --> 3:2:3.30
Khunphet, Phonlawat
When, when?
3:2:3.40 --> 3:2:6.750
Khunphet, Phonlawat
When puppet devices, so the Fileset had the attribute.
3:2:6.880 --> 3:2:21.330
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So, so and the the purpose of attribute it to try to group the data like you have the data from content A, the data from content B, but it in the same bucket it in the same bucket right?
3:2:21.430 --> 3:2:28.780
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So when you query only the content A, so you get the number of the file set within content A is.
3:2:28.850 --> 3:2:42.720
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Is the hardest step to make it more to reduce that you don't have to get all the fileset in the bucket, but just just providing some option that autopsy with user using this strategy.
3:2:44.260 --> 3:2:54.50
Korenschi, Eduard
Yeah, but I'm sure the self team will document a little bit more when they when they start working on this thing and we'll get to the bottom of it and find the about way of doing.
3:2:54.60 --> 3:3:0.650
Korenschi, Eduard
We are the customers using that one, so I understand, but it doesn't help us too.
3:3:0.290 --> 3:3:5.220
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, but I'll try to reach out someone that that they can understand.
3:3:5.290 --> 3:3:6.390
Khunphet, Phonlawat
They can apply, right?
3:3:6.400 --> 3:3:10.900
Khunphet, Phonlawat
They can apply and and provide you an option when you you deserve it.
3:3:13.10 --> 3:3:13.590
Khunphet, Phonlawat
They're added.
3:3:13.600 --> 3:3:14.840
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Told you, added Kirti underside.
3:3:21.750 --> 3:3:22.660
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, I think that all for me.
3:3:37.90 --> 3:3:37.440
Flagg, Todd
Is.
3:3:35.730 --> 3:3:39.650
Khunphet, Phonlawat
And they have seen in the chat that is the 50 to right.
3:3:42.460 --> 3:3:44.940
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Or is it just the information from the application OK.
3:3:52.990 --> 3:3:53.160
Flagg, Todd
Do.
3:3:54.780 --> 3:3:55.980
Flagg, Todd
Umm hmm.
3:3:59.710 --> 3:4:1.850
Miller, Laurence
When God stop.
3:3:59.290 --> 3:4:4.110
Flagg, Todd
Do we need to open up a TR like a proactive TRT tomorrow?
3:4:4.120 --> 3:4:10.690
Flagg, Todd
There's more of a question to the content OPS team if we still have them on, do we need to open up a proactive like TRT to monitor?
3:4:13.580 --> 3:4:16.10
Flagg, Todd
Kind of the progress of the application or anything tomorrow.
3:4:20.920 --> 3:4:21.310
Flagg, Todd
Oh yes.
3:4:17.520 --> 3:4:21.430
Bielecki, Magdalena
I thought it's Magda and so tomorrow is a holiday and Monday as well.
3:4:26.930 --> 3:4:27.160
Flagg, Todd
To.
3:4:21.440 --> 3:4:27.290
Bielecki, Magdalena
So neither term as their team Sonia will publish and K, because you know what?
3:4:27.300 --> 3:4:28.850
Bielecki, Magdalena
I had to drop off for a minute.
3:4:28.940 --> 3:4:30.150
Bielecki, Magdalena
I mean, for a few minutes earlier.
3:4:30.160 --> 3:4:36.840
Bielecki, Magdalena
Can you just give me a quick summary of, I know it's something to do with our the library, but like you know in two sentences.
3:4:35.500 --> 3:4:40.170
Flagg, Todd
The so the when you meant well, we have two separate issues.
3:4:43.990 --> 3:4:44.210
Bielecki, Magdalena
Yeah.
3:4:40.180 --> 3:4:48.90
Flagg, Todd
One is a performance thing where we've seen the degradation of the the performance. Definitely in the last couple months.
3:4:48.630 --> 3:4:48.950
Bielecki, Magdalena
Yeah.
3:4:48.970 --> 3:4:49.750
Bielecki, Magdalena
So that will, that's.
3:4:48.960 --> 3:4:50.50
Flagg, Todd
I think we know.
3:4:50.460 --> 3:4:50.870
Flagg, Todd
Yeah.
3:4:50.880 --> 3:4:51.520
Flagg, Todd
So that's the.
3:4:51.530 --> 3:4:54.110
Flagg, Todd
But then we also today we also have that issue with the files.
3:4:54.790 --> 3:4:54.910
Bielecki, Magdalena
Yes.
3:4:55.10 --> 3:4:55.760
Flagg, Todd
Umm.
3:4:55.770 --> 3:4:56.460
Flagg, Todd
Getting delivered.
3:4:56.470 --> 3:4:57.530
Flagg, Todd
So the issue with the files.
3:4:59.520 --> 3:5:4.30
Flagg, Todd
Seems to be another authentication kind of perhaps issue, maybe with the load balancer?
3:5:4.570 --> 3:5:8.290
Flagg, Todd
I think that's kind of where, where that's kind of leading to.
3:5:11.10 --> 3:5:11.660
Flagg, Todd
Umm.
3:5:11.10 --> 3:5:12.600
Bielecki, Magdalena
What's the option?
3:5:12.610 --> 3:5:13.250
Bielecki, Magdalena
How to fix that?
3:5:14.250 --> 3:5:18.940
Flagg, Todd
So we think it's just, it's still kind of like a known well.
3:5:18.950 --> 3:5:30.960
Flagg, Todd
I think it, I think it's more of an uh, like, for lack of a better term, it seems like more of a infrastructure kind of issue that they're escalating over to a WSS is what I heard from the AAA team.
3:5:32.350 --> 3:5:32.570
Bielecki, Magdalena
OK.
3:5:34.860 --> 3:5:40.210
Flagg, Todd
So, umm, that being said, it seems like it's very isolated to that.
3:5:40.740 --> 3:5:45.970
Flagg, Todd
I hate to say it's seems very isolated to that one minute or so that we were trying to request files.
3:5:46.790 --> 3:5:47.260
Bielecki, Magdalena
Oh really?
3:5:47.730 --> 3:5:48.560
Flagg, Todd
They didn't see.
3:5:48.570 --> 3:5:50.480
Flagg, Todd
It's not like a massive outage or anything like that.
3:5:50.490 --> 3:5:54.810
Flagg, Todd
It was just the one minute that they were seeing issues on the server.
3:5:57.10 --> 3:6:3.500
Bielecki, Magdalena
OK, so a complete coincidence that we reported the latency yesterday and today's something else happens, OK?
3:6:2.70 --> 3:6:3.920
Flagg, Todd
Correct, correct.
3:6:3.990 --> 3:6:6.930
Flagg, Todd
Correct, because one of them is actually more AAA related.
3:6:6.940 --> 3:6:8.60
Flagg, Todd
The other one is more.
3:6:9.420 --> 3:6:16.550
Flagg, Todd
Umm has to do with kind of the interaction that is done through this this Rd, this Python library that we use.
3:6:19.190 --> 3:6:23.530
Flagg, Todd
The performance that you all has to do with Python libraries and it's interaction with CFS.
3:6:25.370 --> 3:6:25.630
Bielecki, Magdalena
OK.
3:6:25.870 --> 3:6:34.360
Flagg, Todd
So we're going to, that's going to take a little bit more time, the performance issue that we keep seeing, the performance degradation.
3:6:34.630 --> 3:6:42.950
Flagg, Todd
So I don't know if you wanna us to try to do you know, I mean, I know that Esther and Sonia won't run tomorrow, I believe, but won't us cache fall?
3:6:42.960 --> 3:6:45.60
Flagg, Todd
Backs run tomorrow in Tokyo.
3:6:45.70 --> 3:6:45.570
Flagg, Todd
Swap rate.
3:6:44.820 --> 3:6:49.820
Bielecki, Magdalena
A cash flow bugs cash flow box runs from image right there.
3:6:49.580 --> 3:6:50.200
Flagg, Todd
Correct. Yeah.
3:6:49.830 --> 3:6:51.850
Bielecki, Magdalena
They are not on our FY yet.
3:6:52.490 --> 3:6:52.800
Flagg, Todd
Correct.
3:6:52.220 --> 3:6:54.120
Bielecki, Magdalena
And Tokyo, Tokyo.
3:6:54.130 --> 3:6:54.330
Bielecki, Magdalena
Shoot.
3:6:54.340 --> 3:6:56.910
Bielecki, Magdalena
Yeah, I don't think there is any holiday.
3:6:57.590 --> 3:6:57.810
Flagg, Todd
OK.
3:6:57.40 --> 3:7:2.110
Bielecki, Magdalena
For Tokyo swap and they also reported there was an email from Jim earlier today.
3:7:2.470 --> 3:7:2.650
Flagg, Todd
Yeah.
3:7:6.370 --> 3:7:6.530
Flagg, Todd
Yeah.
3:7:2.160 --> 3:7:8.500
Bielecki, Magdalena
They also reported an increase from 4 1/2 minutes to 7 something, so there's also quite and yeah.
3:7:9.470 --> 3:7:12.840
Bielecki, Magdalena
So perhaps uh well, Jim won't be in online anymore.
3:7:13.750 --> 3:7:15.760
Bielecki, Magdalena
Uh, yeah.
3:7:17.250 --> 3:7:17.480
Bielecki, Magdalena
Good.
3:7:17.520 --> 3:7:17.940
Bielecki, Magdalena
Yeah.
3:7:17.500 --> 3:7:18.390
Flagg, Todd
Let me see.
3:7:18.400 --> 3:7:19.440
Flagg, Todd
I don't.
3:7:17.950 --> 3:7:20.420
Bielecki, Magdalena
Give send, send him a note, a message and.
3:7:25.100 --> 3:7:25.320
Bielecki, Magdalena
Yeah.
3:7:23.30 --> 3:7:26.600
Flagg, Todd
I will, I'll reply to that one on that and just see if they want.
3:7:27.190 --> 3:7:31.120
Flagg, Todd
Umm, I haven't checked to see if Ganesh, is available.
3:7:31.130 --> 3:7:32.400
Flagg, Todd
He was sick yesterday.
3:7:32.710 --> 3:7:34.770
Flagg, Todd
I might be able to see a Belinda might be unavailable.
3:7:34.780 --> 3:7:36.550
Flagg, Todd
Like, actually, she might be out of the office today.
3:7:38.170 --> 3:7:38.720
Flagg, Todd
Uh.
3:7:38.730 --> 3:7:39.800
Flagg, Todd
Could be problematic.
3:7:40.750 --> 3:7:41.560
Flagg, Todd
Let me check. I'll.
3:7:41.570 --> 3:7:43.740
Flagg, Todd
I'll let me check and then I'll reply to Jims email.
3:7:44.570 --> 3:7:44.730
Bielecki, Magdalena
OK.
3:7:45.790 --> 3:7:46.430
Flagg, Todd
Umm.
3:7:46.480 --> 3:7:46.920
Flagg, Todd
Yeah.
3:7:46.970 --> 3:7:48.20
Flagg, Todd
So that's kind of the.
3:7:48.430 --> 3:7:49.520
Flagg, Todd
That's where we stand right now.
3:7:49.530 --> 3:7:52.530
Flagg, Todd
If we need to do, I forgot it was a holiday on Monday too, so.
3:7:53.10 --> 3:7:53.450
Bielecki, Magdalena
No problem.
3:7:54.430 --> 3:7:58.770
Flagg, Todd
Let me maybe maybe we get through that.
3:7:59.530 --> 3:8:3.800
Flagg, Todd
Umm is the content team online on Monday?
3:8:4.220 --> 3:8:6.390
Bielecki, Magdalena
We are online on tomorrow and Monday.
3:8:7.20 --> 3:8:7.210
Flagg, Todd
Yes.
3:8:10.40 --> 3:8:10.280
Flagg, Todd
Sure.
3:8:6.700 --> 3:8:12.490
Bielecki, Magdalena
We are only doing like skeletal coverage for people tomorrow and Friday.
3:8:12.500 --> 3:8:17.660
Bielecki, Magdalena
Sorry, Monday will be 6 and so if there's any, yeah.
3:8:17.850 --> 3:8:18.10
Flagg, Todd
Yeah.
3:8:18.900 --> 3:8:21.0
Flagg, Todd
Let's umm I'll ping you.
3:8:19.370 --> 3:8:21.280
Bielecki, Magdalena
And dropped them a message.
3:8:21.40 --> 3:8:21.520
Flagg, Todd
I'll pick.
3:8:30.340 --> 3:8:30.550
Bielecki, Magdalena
Mm-hmm.
3:8:21.940 --> 3:8:35.650
Flagg, Todd
Yeah, I'll ping the team on Monday or so and we can make a decision on whether or not to do like a proactive TRT before the Esther or Sonia runs, just to make sure that if there's something I, I mean, I might be, I might be wrong here.
3:8:36.750 --> 3:8:41.270
Flagg, Todd
I I feel like I need to follow up with surgery on that one issue because he said it failed and QA as well.
3:8:44.60 --> 3:8:44.660
Bielecki, Magdalena
In UAT.
3:8:42.70 --> 3:8:45.190
Flagg, Todd
Umm, but I need to follow up with him on that.
3:8:45.890 --> 3:8:46.190
Flagg, Todd
Yeah.
3:8:47.120 --> 3:8:47.700
Bielecki, Magdalena
In UAT.
3:8:47.10 --> 3:8:50.370
Flagg, Todd
UM, yeah, so I need, yeah.
3:8:48.740 --> 3:8:50.460
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
On the 18th, but OK.
3:8:51.820 --> 3:8:52.300
Bielecki, Magdalena
Not Qi.
3:8:52.310 --> 3:8:52.890
Bielecki, Magdalena
Yeah, annuity.
3:8:55.740 --> 3:8:56.660
Flagg, Todd
That using the same ID.
3:8:58.760 --> 3:8:59.710
Flagg, Todd
The same machine ID.
3:9:0.750 --> 3:9:5.570
Miller, Laurence
I think somebody said that they both go to prod itself and the other one goes to a dev self or something like that.
3:9:5.580 --> 3:9:7.820
Miller, Laurence
I remember from the other chat something like that was it Todd?
3:9:9.880 --> 3:9:10.330
Miller, Laurence
You are.
3:9:12.190 --> 3:9:12.510
Miller, Laurence
Yeah.
3:9:9.390 --> 3:9:14.240
Flagg, Todd
Should go to prod staging self like self has prod, staging and prod life.
3:9:12.520 --> 3:9:17.140
Miller, Laurence
UAT, UAT, UAT and prod go to the same sort of a back end.
3:9:17.150 --> 3:9:17.740
Miller, Laurence
Sort of self.
3:9:19.510 --> 3:9:19.800
Flagg, Todd
Yeah.
3:9:17.750 --> 3:9:25.660
Miller, Laurence
It was in the earlier to chat I think, but the QA and Dev go to a a non prod version of those things.
3:9:26.570 --> 3:9:26.770
Flagg, Todd
OK.
3:9:28.230 --> 3:9:32.200
Miller, Laurence
Which is why we're seeing it in Prod and UAT and not in the others.
3:9:33.560 --> 3:9:35.870
Miller, Laurence
Or that was suggested as the reason for it.
3:9:36.180 --> 3:9:41.430
Miller, Laurence
I think it was in my one of the chats from earlier this morning, but don't quote me on it, but I think that's what I remember seeing.
3:9:45.930 --> 3:9:47.90
Flagg, Todd
So why would that fail though?
3:9:48.270 --> 3:9:49.130
Miller, Laurence
Nothing you did did it.
3:9:47.950 --> 3:9:49.460
Flagg, Todd
If it's going to different source.
3:9:52.920 --> 3:10:0.760
Flagg, Todd
So if prod, staging or UAT whatever, we're gonna call it is pointed to a different environment and it failed.
3:10:1.950 --> 3:10:2.840
Miller, Laurence
But I think it did though.
3:10:4.660 --> 3:10:5.310
Flagg, Todd
I thought they just.
3:10:2.850 --> 3:10:5.410
Miller, Laurence
Did it or did or like I say, I'd have to get back to the other.
3:10:5.50 --> 3:10:9.640
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Actually use the same environment you AT and produce the same.
3:10:10.470 --> 3:10:12.830
Matviienko, Serhii (External)
Async affairs, David, all those things.
3:10:12.760 --> 3:10:14.240
Miller, Laurence
Yeah, that's what I thought, yeah.
3:10:14.160 --> 3:10:16.660
Flagg, Todd
Ohh, so they're using the same prod environment.
3:10:17.140 --> 3:10:19.910
Miller, Laurence
That's one thing they're using the same they're going to the same stuff.
3:10:19.920 --> 3:10:20.60
Miller, Laurence
Yeah.
3:10:18.210 --> 3:10:21.360
Flagg, Todd
Uh, sorry, I thought you said the reason different ones OHV.
3:10:21.290 --> 3:10:21.860
Miller, Laurence
No, no, no.
3:10:21.410 --> 3:10:23.100
Flagg, Todd
Sorry, I'm just my brain is not working right.
3:10:22.70 --> 3:10:25.130
Miller, Laurence
UAT and Prod are using exactly the same Qi isn't.
3:10:26.460 --> 3:10:26.930
Flagg, Todd
OK.
3:10:27.290 --> 3:10:27.550
Miller, Laurence
Yeah.
3:10:27.100 --> 3:10:27.670
Flagg, Todd
That makes sense.
3:10:31.520 --> 3:10:34.590
Flagg, Todd
That's CFS had a prod staging.
3:10:35.420 --> 3:10:35.990
Khunphet, Phonlawat
No, no.
3:10:36.360 --> 3:10:37.270
Khunphet, Phonlawat
We don't have it yet.
3:10:37.580 --> 3:10:38.780
Khunphet, Phonlawat
We already have one production.
3:10:40.910 --> 3:10:43.250
Flagg, Todd
Are you guys still on a WS2 accounts?
3:10:45.210 --> 3:10:47.510
Khunphet, Phonlawat
We are at the account 3.
3:10:48.550 --> 3:10:48.830
Flagg, Todd
OK.
3:10:51.330 --> 3:10:51.980
Flagg, Todd
Aren't you?
3:10:49.570 --> 3:10:53.640
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, we have a new account and we are live live region.
3:10:54.530 --> 3:10:54.810
Flagg, Todd
OK.
3:10:58.800 --> 3:11:0.120
Khunphet, Phonlawat
And I'm wondering one thing.
3:10:58.550 --> 3:11:2.230
Flagg, Todd
I thought you somehow gotten around and I count 3 upgrade OK.
3:11:1.820 --> 3:11:3.970
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, I am a.
3:11:3.980 --> 3:11:6.980
Khunphet, Phonlawat
How about the stating that you ETC.
3:11:6.990 --> 3:11:9.180
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Stating from sales.
3:11:12.510 --> 3:11:18.480
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I mean, I am wondering on the endpoint that's called CF O you say like are you 80 and pot calling?
3:11:18.490 --> 3:11:19.640
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Save it production right?
3:11:19.810 --> 3:11:21.580
Khunphet, Phonlawat
And how about stating?
3:11:22.860 --> 3:11:23.530
Khunphet, Phonlawat
That's the thing.
3:11:23.540 --> 3:11:24.270
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Either you 80.
3:11:24.160 --> 3:11:25.30
Flagg, Todd
That's our staging.
3:11:25.40 --> 3:11:25.980
Flagg, Todd
That's our US, yeah.
3:11:26.610 --> 3:11:27.750
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Ah, OK, OK, got it.
3:11:27.980 --> 3:11:33.230
Flagg, Todd
Hmm, I think we need another like a formal environmental mapping.
3:11:34.470 --> 3:11:40.170
Flagg, Todd
Uh diagram that shows what each account is pointed to and what it's going.
3:11:40.180 --> 3:11:44.900
Flagg, Todd
So that sorry, mag, that that's that was a very long discussion on that's why it failed.
3:11:46.190 --> 3:11:47.410
Bielecki, Magdalena
No problem, no problem.
3:11:46.440 --> 3:11:48.80
Flagg, Todd
I thought it failed in QA as well.
3:11:47.420 --> 3:11:48.440
Bielecki, Magdalena
I I think I follow.
3:11:49.210 --> 3:11:49.770
Flagg, Todd
Yes.
3:11:50.550 --> 3:11:58.10
Flagg, Todd
So regardless, I think we need to get back to a question of whether or not we need to do a proactive TRT UM on Tuesday.
3:12:0.770 --> 3:12:2.350
Bielecki, Magdalena
Yeah, sounds good to me. Yeah.
3:12:0.640 --> 3:12:12.870
Flagg, Todd
I have a feeling it's we're gonna like the problem is, is that we're going to see slowness until we get this fixed and there's really not a great way to fix it quickly.
3:12:13.520 --> 3:12:15.940
Flagg, Todd
O,. Yeah.
3:12:19.410 --> 3:12:20.980
Flagg, Todd
At least not that I'm aware of it the 2nd.
3:12:31.480 --> 3:12:38.570
Flagg, Todd
So let me take that away with the team magnet and we'll we can refresh this on Monday and try to figure out if we need to do some kind of proactive TRT.
3:12:39.180 --> 3:12:54.120
Flagg, Todd
My my thought is this is that if we have a fail at that time and we're all on the line, we can manually rerun the job and we'd probably have better chance if it if there was some sort of flutter with the with the network.
3:12:54.70 --> 3:12:54.580
Miller, Laurence
The local.
3:12:54.130 --> 3:12:57.210
Flagg, Todd
I don't think we would have the file issue, we just may have a performance issue though.
3:12:57.310 --> 3:12:57.950
Miller, Laurence
Yes, speaking.
3:12:59.920 --> 3:13:3.350
Bielecki, Magdalena
Yeah, yeah, I understand that these issues are not related so.
3:13:2.620 --> 3:13:3.670
Miller, Laurence
Well, I really how are you?
3:13:4.970 --> 3:13:5.240
Flagg, Todd
Umm.
3:13:10.450 --> 3:13:10.620
Flagg, Todd
Yep.
3:13:5.230 --> 3:13:11.900
Bielecki, Magdalena
Unless there, unless we have we're unlucky and experience the same issue with the file, then should only see the latency.
3:13:12.250 --> 3:13:18.810
Bielecki, Magdalena
And do you have any time frame on how long it's going to take to to fix that?
3:13:19.690 --> 3:13:20.600
Flagg, Todd
On the performance thing.
3:13:21.470 --> 3:13:21.730
Bielecki, Magdalena
Yeah.
3:13:21.870 --> 3:13:26.240
Flagg, Todd
I'm going to have a chat with Edward, Sergey, et cetera, et cetera.
3:13:26.780 --> 3:13:27.370
Bielecki, Magdalena
Hmm, OK.
3:13:26.670 --> 3:13:27.920
Flagg, Todd
So I don't have it at this time.
3:13:28.110 --> 3:13:29.80
Flagg, Todd
I'll need to get it.
3:13:29.360 --> 3:13:32.300
Flagg, Todd
Didn't need to bear with me and we can kind of let me walk through it with them.
3:13:34.220 --> 3:13:35.850
Bielecki, Magdalena
OK. OK.
3:13:36.280 --> 3:13:37.10
Bielecki, Magdalena
Yeah, I'm.
3:13:35.350 --> 3:13:42.140
Flagg, Todd
So maybe I can get some high level estimates by tomorrow or something, but yeah, you'll need just give me some time.
3:13:43.20 --> 3:13:43.790
Bielecki, Magdalena
Yeah, no problem.
3:13:43.800 --> 3:13:44.190
Bielecki, Magdalena
Yeah. I'm.
3:13:44.200 --> 3:13:44.510
Bielecki, Magdalena
I'm.
3:13:44.620 --> 3:13:49.320
Bielecki, Magdalena
I'm off for for the Easter holidays, but I can check my emails from home.
3:13:49.330 --> 3:13:50.690
Bielecki, Magdalena
That's fine and.
3:13:50.330 --> 3:13:52.820
Flagg, Todd
Yeah, I mean, I'll send, I'll send something out to the wider group.
3:13:54.710 --> 3:13:54.960
Flagg, Todd
Hmm.
3:13:53.780 --> 3:13:57.130
Bielecki, Magdalena
Cool and and anything else.
3:13:59.230 --> 3:13:59.420
Bielecki, Magdalena
No.
3:14:0.220 --> 3:14:0.970
Bielecki, Magdalena
Now I think that's it.
3:14:4.450 --> 3:14:4.670
Flagg, Todd
OK.
3:14:12.410 --> 3:14:13.860
Flagg, Todd
I think we will.
3:14:13.950 --> 3:14:15.750
Flagg, Todd
We need to have a bunch of stuff we need to follow up on.
3:14:17.310 --> 3:14:18.40
Flagg, Todd
Is everyone OK?
3:14:18.40 --> 3:14:19.650
Flagg, Todd
With us closing out the TRT at the time.
3:14:31.670 --> 3:14:32.230
Flagg, Todd
In like.
3:14:36.210 --> 3:14:36.540
Flagg, Todd
OK.
3:14:31.610 --> 3:14:40.640
Khunphet, Phonlawat
If you act, if you ask me, I think I think I'm OK, but I'm not sure other people because people keep quiet, so we don't know, but I think.
3:14:45.340 --> 3:14:48.580
Flagg, Todd
Well, if they don't speak up, then I can't change their mind.
3:14:48.60 --> 3:14:49.230
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, that is the problem.
3:14:49.280 --> 3:14:52.140
Khunphet, Phonlawat
That is a problem, but because we we need to think.
3:14:51.390 --> 3:14:52.400
Sathapanapatr, Ekachai
No from my side.
3:14:52.150 --> 3:14:52.850
Khunphet, Phonlawat
What?
3:14:53.460 --> 3:14:53.750
Khunphet, Phonlawat
What?
3:14:53.760 --> 3:14:53.950
Khunphet, Phonlawat
What?
3:14:53.960 --> 3:14:58.510
Khunphet, Phonlawat
What we are doing right now, right that I think it's, yeah, try to figure it out from that slide.
3:14:58.520 --> 3:15:7.930
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So it take more than maybe a day or something like that that they said or late than, but it's not, they may not come back in maybe one hour, 2 hour, something like that.
3:15:8.280 --> 3:15:8.460
Flagg, Todd
Hmm.
3:15:8.140 --> 3:15:11.460
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So we need to think what we are doing right and.
3:15:13.650 --> 3:15:13.810
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah.
3:15:18.590 --> 3:15:25.400
Flagg, Todd
Well, I guess I hear like several actions from at least the service issue, the files missing the AAA issue.
3:15:25.570 --> 3:15:30.880
Flagg, Todd
I should get a response and a better log on that by tomorrow on the performance issue.
3:15:30.890 --> 3:15:39.450
Flagg, Todd
I need to take that away with the R, team to figure out how we can better address that and how long that might take.
3:15:45.160 --> 3:15:45.530
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah.
3:15:45.610 --> 3:15:47.90
Flagg, Todd
I would not expose.
3:15:45.540 --> 3:15:47.910
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So see, we have to (External) already.
3:15:47.920 --> 3:15:49.720
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, we have the next action already.
3:15:50.690 --> 3:15:50.850
Flagg, Todd
Umm.
3:15:49.730 --> 3:15:51.860
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah. Umm.
3:15:52.910 --> 3:15:56.240
Flagg, Todd
So I think from there we can probably take this away and see if we can.
3:15:56.530 --> 3:16:6.480
Flagg, Todd
Obviously, we won't have a service issue tomorrow, at least with the term Sonia in term mester because of holidays.
3:16:10.340 --> 3:16:13.280
Flagg, Todd
I don't believe we'll have one on Monday because it won't run because of holiday.
3:16:14.730 --> 3:16:18.960
Flagg, Todd
Umm, but we do have a risk on this other rate that's running on the system called Tokyo swap rate.
3:16:20.270 --> 3:16:22.960
Flagg, Todd
So so hopefully.
3:16:24.330 --> 3:16:29.160
Flagg, Todd
We have a lower risk, uh, or lower impact? Umm.
3:16:26.700 --> 3:16:30.740
Khunphet, Phonlawat
I think we need to keep an eye on, we need to keep an eye on and keep monitoring.
3:16:30.750 --> 3:16:31.920
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Keep an eye on, yeah.
3:16:32.100 --> 3:16:32.250
Flagg, Todd
Yeah.
3:16:33.350 --> 3:16:36.590
Flagg, Todd
I will see if I can get at least an L2 team.
3:16:38.220 --> 3:16:38.570
Flagg, Todd
Uh.
3:16:38.580 --> 3:16:40.770
Flagg, Todd
Available tonight during the Tokyo swap rate run.
3:16:46.320 --> 3:16:46.610
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah.
3:16:54.330 --> 3:16:54.520
Flagg, Todd
Hmm.
3:16:46.620 --> 3:16:54.870
Khunphet, Phonlawat
And another thing that if the issue happened, right and we have TRT, how we can get them to join the call quickly? Something like that.
3:16:55.80 --> 3:16:55.570
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah.
3:16:55.620 --> 3:16:56.350
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Do you?
3:16:56.360 --> 3:16:59.660
Khunphet, Phonlawat
You know right, we have the something like that.
3:16:59.700 --> 3:17:7.170
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So we know the right contact point that we can bring them together quickly and then they're we we can get more information.
3:17:11.0 --> 3:17:11.200
Flagg, Todd
Umm.
3:17:7.240 --> 3:17:18.620
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Yeah, because you see, right, we we sit in the call and yeah, it takes very long time there and trying to looking for some improvement improvement in the future. Umm.
3:17:19.810 --> 3:17:24.220
Flagg, Todd
Umm, maybe I need to follow up with Nishant after this call and try to.
3:17:24.290 --> 3:17:30.980
Flagg, Todd
I think if the proactive call where we have the right people already set up to join, UH might be the best solution, right?
3:17:31.390 --> 3:17:33.330
Flagg, Todd
We're all familiar with the issue at this point in time.
3:17:34.200 --> 3:17:34.590
Khunphet, Phonlawat
Umm.
3:17:34.920 --> 3:17:41.570
Flagg, Todd
I do always have a bit of a goal that we should be able to get that TRT together and get the right people involved within 10 minutes.
3:17:42.240 --> 3:17:45.360
Flagg, Todd
UM, if there's a a major service issue.
3:17:48.170 --> 3:17:50.690
Khunphet, Phonlawat
That would be great if we hadn't do it, yeah.
3:17:59.20 --> 3:18:2.970
Flagg, Todd
OK, let me follow up with a couple of you and we'll we'll take it from there then.
3:18:10.630 --> 3:18:11.110
Khunphet, Phonlawat
OK, OK.
3:18:11.0 --> 3:18:11.200
Flagg, Todd
OK.
3:18:11.120 --> 3:18:12.130
Khunphet, Phonlawat
So we can end the call.
3:18:12.920 --> 3:18:13.120
